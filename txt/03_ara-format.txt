<lb n="04000"/>| <emph>Araby</emph>
<lb n="04001"/>| <p>North Richmond Street, being blind, was a quiet street ex=
<lb n="04002"/>| cept at the hour when the Christian Brothers' School set the
<lb n="04003"/>| boys free. An uninhabited house of two storeys stood at the
<lb n="04004"/>| blind end, detached from its neighbours in a square ground.
<lb n="04005"/>| The other houses of the street, conscious of decent lives within
<lb n="04006"/>| them, gazed at one another with brown imperturbable faces.</p>
<lb n="04007"/>| <p>The former tenant of our house, a priest, had died in the
<lb n="04008"/>| back drawingroom. Air, musty from having been long en=
<lb n="04009"/>| closed, hung in all the rooms and the waste room behind the
<lb n="04010"/>| kitchen was littered with old useless papers. Among these I
<lb n="04011"/>| found a few papercovered books, the pages of which were
<lb n="04012"/>| curled and damp: <emph>The Abbot</emph> by Walter Scott, <emph>The Devout
<lb n="04013"/>| Communicant</emph> and <emph>The Memoirs of Vidocq.</emph> I liked the last best
<lb n="04014"/>| because its leaves were yellow. The wild garden behind the
<lb n="04015"/>| house contained a central apple tree and a few straggling
<lb n="04016"/>| bushes under one of which I found the late tenant's rusty
<lb n="04017"/>| bicycle pump. He had been a very charitable priest; in his will
<lb n="04018"/>| he had left all his money to institutions and the furniture of his
<lb n="04019"/>| house to his sister.</p>
<lb n="04020"/>| <p>When the short days of winter came dusk fell before we had
<lb n="04021"/>| well eaten our dinners. When we met in the street the houses
<lb n="04022"/>| had grown sombre. The space of sky above us was the colour
<lb n="04023"/>| of everchanging violet and towards it the lamps of the street
<lb n="04024"/>| lifted their feeble lanterns. The cold air stung us and we played
<lb n="04025"/>| till our bodies glowed. Our shouts echoed in the silent street.
<lb n="04026"/>| The career of our play brought us through the dark muddy
<lb n="04027"/>| lanes behind the houses where we ran the gantlet of the rough
<lb n="04028"/>| tribes from the cottages, to the back doors of the dark dripping
<lb n="04029"/>| gardens where odours arose from the ashpits, to the dark
<lb n="04030"/>| odorous stables where a coachman smoothed and combed the
<lb n="04031"/>| horse or shook music from the buckled harness. When we re=
<lb n="04032"/>| turned to the street light from the kitchen windows had filled
<lb n="04033"/>| the areas. If my uncle was seen turning the corner we hid in the
<lb n="04034"/>| shadow until we had seen him safely housed. Or if Mangan's
<lb n="04035"/>| sister came out on the doorstep to call her brother in to his tea
<lb n="04036"/>| we watched her from our shadow peer up and down the street.
<lb n="04037"/>| We waited to see whether she would remain or go in and if she
<lb n="04038"/>| remained we left our shadow and walked up to Mangan's steps
<lb n="04039"/>| resignedly. She was waiting for us, her figure defined by the
<lb n="04040"/>| light from the half-opened door. Her brother always teased her
<lb n="04041"/>| before he obeyed and I stood by the railings looking at her. Her
<lb n="04042"/>| dress swung as she moved her body and the soft rope of her
<lb n="04043"/>| hair tossed from side to side.</p>
<lb n="04044"/>| <p>Every morning I lay on the floor in the front parlour
<lb n="04045"/>| watching her door. The blind was pulled down to within an
<lb n="04046"/>| inch of the sash so that I could not be seen. When she came out
<lb n="04047"/>| on the doorstep my heart leaped. I ran to the hall, seized my
<lb n="04048"/>| books and followed her. I kept her brown figure always in my
<lb n="04049"/>| eye and when we came near the point at which our ways
<lb n="04050"/>| diverged I quickened my pace and passed her. This happened
<lb n="04051"/>| morning after morning. I had never spoken to her except for a
<lb n="04052"/>| few casual words and yet her name was like a summons to all
<lb n="04053"/>| my foolish blood.</p>
<lb n="04054"/>| <p>Her image accompanied me even in places the most hostile
<lb n="04055"/>| to romance. On Saturday evenings when my aunt went market=
<lb n="04056"/>| ing I had to go to carry some of the parcels. We walked through
<lb n="04057"/>| the flaring streets, jostled by drunken men and bargaining
<lb n="04058"/>| women, amid the curses of labourers, the shrill litanies of shop
<lb n="04059"/>| boys who stood on guard by the barrels of pigs' cheeks, the
<lb n="04060"/>| nasal chanting of street singers who sang a <emph>come-all-you</emph> about
<lb n="04061"/>| O'Donovan Rossa or a ballad about the troubles in our native
<lb n="04062"/>| land. These noises converged in a single sensation of life for
<lb n="04063"/>| me: I imagined that I bore my chalice safely through a throng
<lb n="04064"/>| of foes. Her name sprang to my lips at moments in strange
<lb n="04065"/>| prayers and praises which I myself did not understand. My eyes
<lb n="04066"/>| were often full of tears (I could not tell why) and at times a
<lb n="04067"/>| flood from my heart seemed to pour itself out into my bosom. I
<lb n="04068"/>| thought little of the future. I did not know whether I would
<lb n="04069"/>| ever speak to her or not or, if I spoke to her, how I could tell
<lb n="04070"/>| her of my confused adoration. But my body was like a harp
<lb n="04071"/>| and her words and gestures were like fingers running upon the
<lb n="04072"/>| wires.</p>
<lb n="04073"/>| <p>One evening I went into the back drawingroom in which the
<lb n="04074"/>| priest had died. It was a dark rainy evening and there was no
<lb n="04075"/>| sound in the house. Through one of the broken panes I heard
<lb n="04076"/>| the rain impinge upon the earth, the fine incessant needles of
<lb n="04077"/>| water playing in the sodden beds. Some distant lamp or lighted
<lb n="04078"/>| window gleamed below me. I was thankful that I could see so
<lb n="04079"/>| little. All my senses seemed to desire to veil themselves and,
<lb n="04080"/>| feeling that I was about to slip from them, I pressed the palms
<lb n="04081"/>| of my hands together until they trembled, murmuring: <emph>O love!
<lb n="04082"/>| O love!</emph> many times.</p>
<lb n="04083"/>| <p>At last she spoke to me. When she addressed the first words
<lb n="04084"/>| to me I was so confused that I did not know what to answer.
<lb n="04085"/>| She asked me was I going to <emph>Araby.</emph> I forget whether I answered
<lb n="04086"/>| yes or no. It would be a splendid bazaar, she said; she would
<lb n="04087"/>| love to go.
<lb n="04088"/>| <said who="">--</said>And why can't you? I asked.</p>
<lb n="04089"/>| <p>While she spoke she turned a silver bracelet round and
<lb n="04090"/>| round her wrist. She could not go, she said, because there
<lb n="04091"/>| would be a retreat that week in her convent. Her brother and
<lb n="04092"/>| two other boys were fighting for their caps and I was alone at
<lb n="04093"/>| the railings. She held one of the spikes, bowing her head to=
<lb n="04094"/>| wards me. The light from the lamp opposite our door caught
<lb n="04095"/>| the white curve of her neck, lit up the hair that rested there
<lb n="04096"/>| and, falling, lit up the hand upon the railing. It fell over one
<lb n="04097"/>| side of her dress and caught the white border of a petticoat, just
<lb n="04098"/>| visible as she stood at ease.
<lb n="04099"/>| <said who="">--</said>It's well for you, she said.
<lb n="04100"/>| <said who="">--</said>If I go, I said, I will bring you something.</p>
<lb n="04101"/>| <p>What innumerable follies laid waste my waking and sleeping
<lb n="04102"/>| thoughts after that evening! I wished to annihilate the tedious
<lb n="04103"/>| intervening days. I chafed against the work of school. At night
<lb n="04104"/>| in my bedroom and by day in the classroom her image came
<lb n="04105"/>| between me and the page I strove to read. The syllables of the
<lb n="04106"/>| word <emph>Araby</emph> were called to me through the silence in which my
<lb n="04107"/>| soul luxuriated and cast an eastern enchantment over me. I
<lb n="04108"/>| asked for leave to go to the bazaar on Saturday night. My aunt
<lb n="04109"/>| was surprised and hoped it was not some freemason affair. I
<lb n="04110"/>| answered few questions in class. I watched my master's face
<lb n="04111"/>| pass from amiability to sternness; he hoped I was not beginning
<lb n="04112"/>| to idle. I could not call my wandering thoughts together. I had
<lb n="04113"/>| hardly any patience with the serious work of life which, now
<lb n="04114"/>| that it stood between me and my desire, seemed to me child's
<lb n="04115"/>| play, ugly monotonous child's play.</p>
<lb n="04116"/>| <p>On Saturday morning I reminded my uncle that I wished to
<lb n="04117"/>| go to the bazaar in the evening. He was fussing at the hallstand,
<lb n="04118"/>| looking for the hatbrush, and answered me curtly:
<lb n="04119"/>| <said who="">--</said>Yes, boy, I know.</p>
<lb n="04120"/>| <p>As he was in the hall I could not go into the front parlour
<lb n="04121"/>| and lie at the window. I left the house in bad humour and
<lb n="04122"/>| walked slowly towards the school. The air was pitilessly raw
<lb n="04123"/>| and already my heart misgave me.</p>
<lb n="04124"/>| <p>When I came home to dinner my uncle had not yet been
<lb n="04125"/>| home. Still it was early. I sat staring at the clock for some time
<lb n="04126"/>| and when its ticking began to irritate me I left the room. I
<lb n="04127"/>| mounted the staircase and gained the upper part of the house.
<lb n="04128"/>| The high cold empty gloomy rooms liberated me and I went
<lb n="04129"/>| from room to room singing. From the front window I saw my
<lb n="04130"/>| companions playing below in the street. Their cries reached me
<lb n="04131"/>| weakened and indistinct and, leaning my forehead against the
<lb n="04132"/>| cool glass, I looked over at the dark house where she lived. I
<lb n="04133"/>| may have stood there for an hour seeing nothing but the
<lb n="04134"/>| brownclad figure cast by my imagination, touched discreetly by
<lb n="04135"/>| the lamplight at the curved neck, at the hand upon the railings
<lb n="04136"/>| and at the border below the dress.</p>
<lb n="04137"/>| <p>When I came downstairs again I found Mrs Mercer sitting at
<lb n="04138"/>| the fire. She was an old garrulous woman, a pawnbroker's
<lb n="04139"/>| widow who collected used stamps for some pious purpose. I
<lb n="04140"/>| had to endure the gossip of the teatable. The meal was
<lb n="04141"/>| prolonged beyond an hour and still my uncle did not come.
<lb n="04142"/>| Mrs Mercer stood up to go: she was sorry she couldn't wait
<lb n="04143"/>| any longer but it was after eight o'clock and she did not like to
<lb n="04144"/>| be out late as the night air was bad for her. When she had gone
<lb n="04145"/>| I began to walk up and down the room, clenching my fists. My
<lb n="04146"/>| aunt said:
<lb n="04147"/>| <said who="">--</said>I'm afraid you may put off your bazaar for this night of Our
<lb n="04148"/>| Lord.</p>
<lb n="04149"/>| <p>At nine o'clock I heard my uncle's latchkey in the halldoor. I
<lb n="04150"/>| heard him talking to himself and heard the hallstand rocking
<lb n="04151"/>| when it had received the weight of his overcoat. I could
<lb n="04152"/>| interpret these signs. When he was midway through his dinner I
<lb n="04153"/>| asked him to give me the money to go to the bazaar. He had
<lb n="04154"/>| forgotten.
<lb n="04155"/>| <said who="">--</said>The people are in bed and after their first sleep now, he said.</p>
<lb n="04156"/>| <p>I did not smile. My aunt said to him energetically:
<lb n="04157"/>| <said who="">--</said>Can't you give him the money and let him go? You've kept
<lb n="04158"/>| him late enough as it is.</p>
<lb n="04159"/>| <p>My uncle said he was very sorry he had forgotten. He said
<lb n="04160"/>| he believed in the old saying: <emph>All work and no play makes Jack
<lb n="04161"/>| a dull boy.</emph> He asked me where I was going and when I had told
<lb n="04162"/>| him a second time he asked me did I know <emph>The Arab's Farewell
<lb n="04163"/>| to his Steed.</emph> When I left the kitchen he was about to recite the
<lb n="04164"/>| opening lines of the piece to my aunt.</p>
<lb n="04165"/>| <p>I held a florin tightly in my hand as I strode down Bucking=
<lb n="04166"/>| ham Street towards the station. The sight of the streets
<lb n="04167"/>| thronged with buyers and glaring with gas recalled to me the
<lb n="04168"/>| purpose of my journey. I took my seat in a third class carriage
<lb n="04169"/>| of a deserted train. After an intolerable delay the train moved
<lb n="04170"/>| out of the station slowly. It crept onward among ruinous
<lb n="04171"/>| houses and over the twinkling river. At Westland Row Station a
<lb n="04172"/>| crowd of people pressed at the carriage doors; but the porters
<lb n="04173"/>| moved them back, saying that it was a special train for the
<lb n="04174"/>| bazaar. I remained alone in the bare carriage. In a few minutes
<lb n="04175"/>| the train drew up beside an improvised wooden platform. I
<lb n="04176"/>| passed out on to the road and saw by the lighted dial of a clock
<lb n="04177"/>| that it was ten minutes to ten. In front of me was a large
<lb n="04178"/>| building which displayed the magical name.</p>
<lb n="04179"/>| <p>I could not find any sixpenny entrance and, fearing that the
<lb n="04180"/>| bazaar would be closed, I passed in quickly through a turnstile,
<lb n="04181"/>| handing a shilling to a wearylooking man. I found myself in a
<lb n="04182"/>| big hall girdled at half its height by a gallery. Nearly all the
<lb n="04183"/>| stalls were closed and the greater part of the hall was in
<lb n="04184"/>| darkness. I recognised a silence like that which pervades a
<lb n="04185"/>| church after a service. I walked into the centre of the bazaar
<lb n="04186"/>| timidly. A few people were gathered about the stalls which
<lb n="04187"/>| were still open. Before a curtain over which the words <emph>Café
<lb n="04188"/>| Chantant</emph> were written in coloured lamps two men were count=
<lb n="04189"/>| ing money on a salver. I listened to the fall of the coins.</p>
<lb n="04190"/>| <p>Remembering with difficulty why I had come I went over to
<lb n="04191"/>| one of the stalls and examined porcelain vases and flowered
<lb n="04192"/>| teasets. At the door of the stall a young lady was talking and
<lb n="04193"/>| laughing with two young gentlemen. I remarked their English
<lb n="04194"/>| accents and listened vaguely to their conversation.
<lb n="04195"/>| <said who="">--</said>O, I never said such a thing!
<lb n="04196"/>| <said who="">--</said>O, but you did!
<lb n="04197"/>| <said who="">--</said>O, but I didn't!
<lb n="04198"/>| <said who="">--</said>Didn't she say that?
<lb n="04199"/>| <said who="">--</said>She did. I heard her.
<lb n="04200"/>| <said who="">--</said>O, there's a ... fib!</p>
<lb n="04201"/>| <p>Observing me the young lady came over and asked me did I
<lb n="04202"/>| wish to buy anything. The tone of her voice was not encour=
<lb n="04203"/>| aging: she seemed to have spoken to me out of a sense of duty. I
<lb n="04204"/>| looked humbly at the great jars that stood like eastern guards
<lb n="04205"/>| at either side of the dark entrance to her stall and murmured:
<lb n="04206"/>| <said who="">--</said>No, thank you.</p>
<lb n="04207"/>| <p>The young lady changed the position of one of the vases and
<lb n="04208"/>| went back to the two young men. They began to talk of the
<lb n="04209"/>| same subject. Once or twice the young lady glanced at me over
<lb n="04210"/>| her shoulder.</p>
<lb n="04211"/>| <p>I lingered before her stall, though I knew my stay was
<lb n="04212"/>| useless, to make my interest in her wares seem the more real.
<lb n="04213"/>| Then I turned away slowly and walked down the middle of the
<lb n="04214"/>| bazaar. I allowed the two pennies to fall against the sixpence in
<lb n="04215"/>| my pocket. I heard a voice call from one end of the gallery that
<lb n="04216"/>| the light was out. The upper part of the hall was now com=
<lb n="04217"/>| pletely dark.</p>
<lb n="04218"/>| <p>Gazing up into the darkness I saw myself as a creature
<lb n="04219"/>| driven and derided by vanity: and my eyes burned with anguish
<lb n="04220"/>| and anger.</p>
