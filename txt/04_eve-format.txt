<lb n="04000"/>| <emph>Eveline</emph>
<lb n="04001"/>| <p>She sat at the window watching the evening invade the av=
<lb n="04002"/>| enue. Her head was leaned against the window curtains and in
<lb n="04003"/>| her nostrils was the odour of dusty cretonne. She was tired.</p>
<lb n="04004"/>| <p>Few people passed. The man out of the last house passed on
<lb n="04005"/>| his way home; she heard his footsteps clacking along the
<lb n="04006"/>| concrete pavement and afterwards crunching on the cinder
<lb n="04007"/>| path before the new red houses. One time there used to be a
<lb n="04008"/>| field there in which they used to play every evening with other
<lb n="04009"/>| people's children. Then a man from Belfast bought the field
<lb n="04010"/>| and built houses in it - not like their little brown houses but
<lb n="04011"/>| bright brick houses with shining roofs. The children of the
<lb n="04012"/>| avenue used to play together in that field - the Devines, the
<lb n="04013"/>| Waters, the Dunns, little Keogh the cripple, she and her
<lb n="04014"/>| brothers and sisters. Ernest, however, never played: he was too
<lb n="04015"/>| grown up. Her father used often to hunt them in out of the
<lb n="04016"/>| field with his blackthorn stick but usually little Keogh used to
<lb n="04017"/>| keep nix and call out when he saw her father coming. Still they
<lb n="04018"/>| seemed to have been rather happy then. Her father was not so
<lb n="04019"/>| bad then, and besides her mother was alive. That was a long
<lb n="04020"/>| time ago; she and her brothers and sisters were all grown up;
<lb n="04021"/>| her mother was dead. Tizzie Dunn was dead, too, and the
<lb n="04022"/>| Waters had gone back to England. Everything changes. Now
<lb n="04023"/>| she was going to go away like the others, to leave her home.</p>
<lb n="04024"/>| <p>Home! She looked round the room reviewing all its familiar
<lb n="04025"/>| objects which she had dusted once a week for so many years,
<lb n="04026"/>| wondering where on earth all the dust came from. Perhaps she
<lb n="04027"/>| would never see again those familiar objects from which she
<lb n="04028"/>| had never dreamed of being divided. And yet during all those
<lb n="04029"/>| years she had never found out the name of the priest whose
<lb n="04030"/>| yellowing photograph hung on the wall above the broken
<lb n="04031"/>| harmonium beside the coloured print of the promises made to
<lb n="04032"/>| Blessed Margaret Mary Alacoque. He had been a school friend
<lb n="04033"/>| of her father's. Whenever he showed the photograph to a
<lb n="04034"/>| visitor her father used to pass it with a casual word:
<lb n="04035"/>| <said who="">--</said>He is in Melbourne now.</p>
<lb n="04036"/>| <p>She had consented to go away, to leave her home. Was that
<lb n="04037"/>| wise? She tried to weigh each side of the question. In her home
<lb n="04038"/>| anyway she had shelter and food; she had those whom she had
<lb n="04039"/>| known all her life about her. Of course she had to work hard
<lb n="04040"/>| both in the house and at business. What would they say of her
<lb n="04041"/>| in the stores when they found out that she had run away with a
<lb n="04042"/>| fellow? Say she was a fool, perhaps; and her place would be
<lb n="04043"/>| filled up by advertisement. Miss Gavan would be glad. She had
<lb n="04044"/>| always had an edge on her, especially whenever there were
<lb n="04045"/>| people listening.
<lb n="04046"/>| <said who="">--</said>Miss Hill, don't you see these ladies are waiting?
<lb n="04047"/>| <said who="">--</said>Look lively, Miss Hill, please.</p>
<lb n="04048"/>| <p>She would not cry many tears at leaving the stores.</p>
<lb n="04049"/>| <p>But in her new home, in a distant unknown country, it
<lb n="04050"/>| would not be like that. Then she would be married- she,
<lb n="04051"/>| Eveline. People would treat her with respect then. She would
<lb n="04052"/>| not be treated as her mother had been. Even now, though she
<lb n="04053"/>| was over nineteen, she sometimes felt herself in danger of her
<lb n="04054"/>| father's violence. She knew it was that that had given her the
<lb n="04055"/>| palpitations. When they were growing up he had never gone
<lb n="04056"/>| for her, like he used to go for Harry and Ernest, because she
<lb n="04057"/>| was a girl; but latterly he had begun to threaten her and say
<lb n="04058"/>| what he would do to her only for her dead mother's sake. And
<lb n="04059"/>| now she had nobody to protect her. Ernest was dead and
<lb n="04060"/>| Harry, who was in the church decorating business, was nearly
<lb n="04061"/>| always down somewhere in the country. Besides, the invariable
<lb n="04062"/>| squabble for money on Saturday nights had begun to weary her
<lb n="04063"/>| unspeakably. She always gave her entire wages - seven shillings
<lb n="04064"/>| - and Harry always sent up what he could but the trouble was
<lb n="04065"/>| to get any money from her father. He said she used to squander
<lb n="04066"/>| the money, that she had no head, that he wasn't going to give
<lb n="04067"/>| her his hard earned money to throw about the streets and much
<lb n="04068"/>| more for he was usually fairly bad of a Saturday night. In the
<lb n="04069"/>| end he would give her the money and ask her had she any
<lb n="04070"/>| intention of buying Sunday's dinner. Then she had to rush out
<lb n="04071"/>| as quickly as she could and do her marketing, holding her black
<lb n="04072"/>| leather purse tightly in her hand as she elbowed her way
<lb n="04073"/>| through the crowds and returning home late under her load of
<lb n="04074"/>| provisions. She had hard work to keep the house together and
<lb n="04075"/>| to see that the two young children who had been left to her
<lb n="04076"/>| charge went to school regularly and got their meals regularly. It
<lb n="04077"/>| was hard work - a hard life - but now that she was about to
<lb n="04078"/>| leave it she did not find it a wholly undesirable life.</p>
<lb n="04079"/>| <p>She was about to explore another life with Frank. Frank was
<lb n="04080"/>| very kind, manly, openhearted. She was to go away with him
<lb n="04081"/>| by the night boat to be his wife and to live with him in Buenos
<lb n="04082"/>| Ayres where he had a home waiting for her. How well she
<lb n="04083"/>| remembered the first time she had seen him; he was lodging in
<lb n="04084"/>| a house on the main road where she used to visit. It seemed a
<lb n="04085"/>| few weeks ago. He was standing at the gate, his peaked cap
<lb n="04086"/>| pushed back on his head and his hair tumbled forward over a
<lb n="04087"/>| face of bronze. Then they had come to know each other. He
<lb n="04088"/>| used to meet her outside the stores every evening and see her
<lb n="04089"/>| home. He took her to see the <emph>Bohemian Girl</emph> and she felt elated
<lb n="04090"/>| as she sat in an unaccustomed part of the theatre with him. He
<lb n="04091"/>| was awfully fond of music and sang a little. People knew that
<lb n="04092"/>| they were courting and when he sang about the lass that loves a
<lb n="04093"/>| sailor she always felt pleasantly confused. He used to call her
<lb n="04094"/>| Poppens out of fun. First of all it had been an excitement for
<lb n="04095"/>| her to have a fellow and then she had begun to like him. He
<lb n="04096"/>| had tales of distant countries. He had started as a deck boy at a
<lb n="04097"/>| pound a month on a ship of the Allan line going out to Canada.
<lb n="04098"/>| He told her the names of the ships he had been on and the
<lb n="04099"/>| names of the different services. He had sailed through the
<lb n="04100"/>| Straits of Magellan and he told her stories of the terrible
<lb n="04101"/>| Patagonians. He had fallen on his feet in Buenos Ayres, he said,
<lb n="04102"/>| and had come over to the old country just for a holiday. Of
<lb n="04103"/>| course, her father had found out the affair and had forbidden
<lb n="04104"/>| her to have anything to say to him:
<lb n="04105"/>| <said who="">--</said>I know these sailor chaps, he said.</p>
<lb n="04106"/>| <p>One day he had quarrelled with Frank and after that she had
<lb n="04107"/>| to meet her lover secretly.</p>
<lb n="04108"/>| <p>The evening deepened in the avenue. The white of two let=
<lb n="04109"/>| ters in her lap grew indistinct. One was to Harry, the other was
<lb n="04110"/>| to her father. Ernest had been her favourite but she liked Harry
<lb n="04111"/>| too. Her father was becoming old lately, she noticed; he would
<lb n="04112"/>| miss her. Sometimes he could be very nice. Not long before,
<lb n="04113"/>| when she had been laid up for a day, he had read her out a
<lb n="04114"/>| ghost story and made toast for her at the fire. Another day,
<lb n="04115"/>| when their mother was alive, they had all gone for a picnic to
<lb n="04116"/>| the Hill of Howth. She remembered her father putting on her
<lb n="04117"/>| mother's bonnet to make the children laugh.</p>
<lb n="04118"/>| <p>Her time was running out but she continued to sit by the
<lb n="04119"/>| window, leaning her head against the window curtain, inhaling
<lb n="04120"/>| the odour of dusty cretonne. Down far in the avenue she could
<lb n="04121"/>| hear a street organ playing. She knew the air. Strange that it
<lb n="04122"/>| should come that very night to remind her of the promise to her
<lb n="04123"/>| mother, her promise to keep the home together as long as she
<lb n="04124"/>| could. She remembered the last night of her mother's illness;
<lb n="04125"/>| she was again in the close dark room at the other side of the
<lb n="04126"/>| hall and outside she heard a melancholy air of Italy. The organ
<lb n="04127"/>| player had been ordered to go away and given sixpence. She
<lb n="04128"/>| remembered her father strutting back into the sickroom saying:
<lb n="04129"/>| <said who="">--</said>Damned Italians! coming over here!</p>
<lb n="04130"/>| <p>As she mused the pitiful vision of her mother's life laid its
<lb n="04131"/>| spell on the very quick of her being - that life of commonplace
<lb n="04132"/>| sacrifices closing in final craziness. She trembled as she heard
<lb n="04133"/>| again her mother's voice saying constantly with foolish insis=
<lb n="04134"/>| tence:
<lb n="04135"/>| <said who="">--</said>Derevaun Seraun! Derevaun Seraun!</p>
<lb n="04136"/>| <p>She stood up in a sudden impulse of terror. Escape! She must
<lb n="04137"/>| escape! Frank would save her. He would give her life, perhaps
<lb n="04138"/>| love too. But she wanted to live. Why should she be unhappy?
<lb n="04139"/>| She had a right to happiness. Frank would take her in his arms,
<lb n="04140"/>| fold her in his arms. He would save her.</p>
<lb />| *  *  *
<lb n="04141"/>| <p>She stood among the swaying crowd in the station at the
<lb n="04142"/>| North Wall. He held her hand and she knew that he was speak=
<lb n="04143"/>| ing to her, saying something about the passage over and over
<lb n="04144"/>| again. The station was full of soldiers with brown baggages.
<lb n="04145"/>| Through the wide doors of the sheds she caught a glimpse of
<lb n="04146"/>| the black mass of the boat lying in beside the quay wall, with
<lb n="04147"/>| illumined portholes. She answered nothing. She felt her cheek
<lb n="04148"/>| pale and cold and out of a maze of distress she prayed to God
<lb n="04149"/>| to direct her, to show her what was her duty. The boat blew a
<lb n="04150"/>| long mournful whistle into the mist. If she went, tomorrow she
<lb n="04151"/>| would be on the sea with Frank, steaming towards Buenos
<lb n="04152"/>| Ayres. Their passage had been booked. Could she still draw
<lb n="04153"/>| back after all he had done for her? Her distress awoke a nausea
<lb n="04154"/>| in her body and she kept moving her lips in silent fervent
<lb n="04155"/>| prayer.</p>
<lb n="04156"/>| <p>A bell clanged upon her heart. She felt him seize her hand:
<lb n="04157"/>| <said who="">--</said>Come!</p>
<lb n="04158"/>| <p>All the seas of the world tumbled about her heart. He was
<lb n="04159"/>| drawing her into them: he would drown her. She gripped with
<lb n="04160"/>| both hands at the iron railing.
<lb n="04161"/>| <said who="">--</said>Come!</p>
<lb n="04162"/>| <p>No! No! No! It was impossible. Her hands clutched the iron
<lb n="04163"/>| in frenzy. Amid the seas she sent a cry of anguish.
<lb n="04164"/>| <said who="">--</said>Eveline! Evvy!</p>
<lb n="04165"/>| <p>He rushed beyond the barrier and called to her to follow. He
<lb n="04166"/>| was shouted at to go on but he still called to her. She set her
<lb n="04167"/>| white face to him, passive, like a helpless animal. Her eyes gave
<lb n="04168"/>| him no sign of love or farewell or recognition.</p>
