<lb n="06000"/>| <emph>Two Gallants</emph>
<lb n="06001"/>| <p>The grey warm evening of August had descended upon the
<lb n="06002"/>| city and a mild warm air, a memory of summer, circulated in
<lb n="06003"/>| the streets. The streets, shuttered for the repose of Sunday,
<lb n="06004"/>| swarmed with a gaily coloured crowd. Like illumined pearls
<lb n="06005"/>| the lamps shone from the summits of their tall poles upon the
<lb n="06006"/>| living texture below which, changing shape and hue unceas=
<lb n="06007"/>| ingly, sent up into the warm grey evening air an unchanging
<lb n="06008"/>| unceasing murmur.</p>
<lb n="06009"/>| <p>Two young men came down the hill of Rutland Square. One
<lb n="06010"/>| of them was just bringing a long monologue to a close. The
<lb n="06011"/>| other, who walked on the verge of the path and was at times
<lb n="06012"/>| obliged to step on to the road owing to his companion's
<lb n="06013"/>| rudeness, wore an amused listening face. He was squat and
<lb n="06014"/>| ruddy. A yachting cap was shoved far back from his forehead
<lb n="06015"/>| and the narrative to which he listened made constant waves of
<lb n="06016"/>| expression break forth over his face from the corners of his
<lb n="06017"/>| nose and eyes and mouth. Little jets of wheezing laughter
<lb n="06018"/>| followed one another out of his convulsed body. His eyes,
<lb n="06019"/>| twinkling with cunning enjoyment, glanced at every moment
<lb n="06020"/>| towards his companion's face. Once or twice he rearranged the
<lb n="06021"/>| light waterproof which he had slung over one shoulder in
<lb n="06022"/>| toreador fashion. His breeches, his white rubber shoes and his
<lb n="06023"/>| jauntily slung waterproof expressed youth. But his figure fell
<lb n="06024"/>| into rotundity at the waist, his hair was scant and grey and his
<lb n="06025"/>| face, when the waves of expression had passed over it, had a
<lb n="06026"/>| ravaged look.</p>
<lb n="06027"/>| <p>When he was quite sure that the narrative had ended he
<lb n="06028"/>| laughed noiselessly for fully half a minute. Then he said:
<lb n="06029"/>| <said who="">--</said>Well! ... That takes the biscuit!</p>
<lb n="06030"/>| <p>His voice seemed winnowed of vigour; and to enforce his
<lb n="06031"/>| words he added with humour:
<lb n="06032"/>| <said who="">--</said>That takes the solitary, unique and, if I may so call it,
<lb n="06033"/>| <emph>recherché</emph> biscuit!</p>
<lb n="06034"/>| <p>He became serious and silent when he had said this. His
<lb n="06035"/>| tongue was tired for he had been talking all the afternoon in a
<lb n="06036"/>| publichouse in Dorset Street. Most people considered Lenehan
<lb n="06037"/>| a leech but in spite of this reputation his adroitness and elo=
<lb n="06038"/>| quence had always prevented his friends from forming any
<lb n="06039"/>| general policy against him. He had a brave manner of coming
<lb n="06040"/>| up to a party of them in a bar and of holding himself nimbly at
<lb n="06041"/>| the borders of the company until he was included in a round.
<lb n="06042"/>| He was a sporting vagrant armed with a vast stock of stories,
<lb n="06043"/>| limericks and riddles. He was insensitive to all kinds of dis=
<lb n="06044"/>| courtesy. No-one knew how he achieved the stern task of living
<lb n="06045"/>| but his name was vaguely associated with racing tissues.
<lb n="06046"/>| <said who="">--</said>And where did you pick her up, Corley? he asked.</p>
<lb n="06047"/>| <p>Corley ran his tongue swiftly along his upper lip.
<lb n="06048"/>| <said who="">--</said>One night, man, he said, I was going along Dame Street and
<lb n="06049"/>| I spotted a fine tart under Waterhouse's clock and said good=
<lb n="06050"/>| night, you know. So we went for a walk round by the canal
<lb n="06051"/>| and she told me she was a slavey in a house in Baggot Street. I
<lb n="06052"/>| put my arm round her and squeezed her a bit that night. Then
<lb n="06053"/>| next Sunday, man, I met her by appointment. We went out to
<lb n="06054"/>| Donnybrook and I brought her into a field there. She told me
<lb n="06055"/>| she used to go with a dairyman. ... It was fine, man. Cigarettes
<lb n="06056"/>| every night she'd bring me and paying the tram out and back.
<lb n="06057"/>| And one night she brought me two bloody fine cigars - O, the
<lb n="06058"/>| real cheese, you know, that the old fellow used to smoke. ... I
<lb n="06059"/>| was afraid, man, she'd get in the family way. But she's up to
<lb n="06060"/>| the dodge.
<lb n="06061"/>| <said who="">--</said>Maybe she thinks you'll marry her, said Lenehan.
<lb n="06062"/>| <said who="">--</said>I told her I was out of a job, said Corley. I told her I was in
<lb n="06063"/>| Pim's. She doesn't know my name. I was too hairy to tell her
<lb n="06064"/>| that. But she thinks I'm a bit of class, you know.</p>
<lb n="06065"/>| <p>Lenehan laughed again noiselessly.
<lb n="06066"/>| <said who="">--</said>Of all the good ones ever I heard, he said, that emphatically
<lb n="06067"/>| takes the biscuit.</p>
<lb n="06068"/>| <p>Corley's stride acknowledged the compliment. The swing of
<lb n="06069"/>| his burly body made his friend execute a few light skips from
<lb n="06070"/>| the path to the roadway and back again. Corley was the son of
<lb n="06071"/>| an inspector of police and he had inherited his father's frame
<lb n="06072"/>| and gait. He walked with his hands by his sides, holding him=
<lb n="06073"/>| self erect and swaying his head from side to side. His head was
<lb n="06074"/>| large, globular and oily, it sweated in all weathers and his large
<lb n="06075"/>| round hat, set upon it sideways, looked like a bulb which had
<lb n="06076"/>| grown out of another. He always stared straight before him as
<lb n="06077"/>| if he were on parade and when he wished to gaze after someone
<lb n="06078"/>| in the street it was necessary for him to move his body from the
<lb n="06079"/>| hips. At present he was about town. Whenever any job was
<lb n="06080"/>| vacant a friend was always ready to give him the hard word.
<lb n="06081"/>| He was often to be seen walking with policemen in plain
<lb n="06082"/>| clothes, talking earnestly. He knew the inner side of all affairs
<lb n="06083"/>| and was fond of delivering final judgments. He spoke without
<lb n="06084"/>| listening to the speech of his companions. His conversation was
<lb n="06085"/>| mainly about himself: what he had said to such a person and
<lb n="06086"/>| what such a person had said to him and what he had said to
<lb n="06087"/>| settle the matter. When he reported these dialogues he aspir=
<lb n="06088"/>| ated the first letter of his name after the manner of Florentines.</p>
<lb n="06089"/>| <p>Lenehan offered his friend a cigarette. As the two young men
<lb n="06090"/>| walked on through the crowd Corley occasionally turned to
<lb n="06091"/>| smile at some of the passing girls but Lenehan's gaze was fixed
<lb n="06092"/>| on the large faint moon circled with a double halo. He watched
<lb n="06093"/>| earnestly the passing of the grey web of twilight across its face.
<lb n="06094"/>| At length he said:
<lb n="06095"/>| <said who="">--</said>Well, ... tell me, Corley, I suppose you'll be able to pull it off
<lb n="06096"/>| all right, eh?</p>
<lb n="06097"/>| <p>Corley closed one eye expressively as an answer.
<lb n="06098"/>| <said who="">--</said>Is she game for that? asked Lenehan dubiously. You never
<lb n="06099"/>| can know women.
<lb n="06100"/>| <said who="">--</said>She's all right, said Corley. I know the way to get around
<lb n="06101"/>| her, man. She's a bit gone on me.
<lb n="06102"/>| <said who="">--</said>You're what I call a gay Lothario, said Lenehan. And the
<lb n="06103"/>| proper kind of a Lothario, too!</p>
<lb n="06104"/>| <p>A shade of mockery relieved the servility of his manner. To
<lb n="06105"/>| save himself he had the habit of leaving his flattery open to the
<lb n="06106"/>| interpretation of raillery. But Corley had not a subtle mind.
<lb n="06107"/>| <said who="">--</said>There's nothing to touch a good slavey, he affirmed. Take
<lb n="06108"/>| my tip for it.
<lb n="06109"/>| <said who="">--</said>By one who has tried them all, said Lenehan.
<lb n="06110"/>| <said who="">--</said>First I used to go with girls, you know, said Corley un=
<lb n="06111"/>| bosoming, girls off the South Circular. I used to take them out,
<lb n="06112"/>| man, on the tram somewhere and pay the tram or take them to
<lb n="06113"/>| a band or a play at the theatre or buy them chocolate and
<lb n="06114"/>| sweets or something that way. I used to spend money on them
<lb n="06115"/>| right enough, he added in a convincing tone, as if he were
<lb n="06116"/>| conscious of being disbelieved.</p>
<lb n="06117"/>| <p>But Lenehan could well believe it; he nodded gravely.
<lb n="06118"/>| <said who="">--</said>I know that game, he said, and it's a mug's game.
<lb n="06119"/>| <said who="">--</said>And damn the thing I ever got out of it, said Corley.
<lb n="06120"/>| <said who="">--</said>Ditto here, said Lenehan.
<lb n="06121"/>| <said who="">--</said>Only off of one of them, said Corley.</p>
<lb n="06122"/>| <p>He moistened his upper lip by running his tongue along it.
<lb n="06123"/>| The recollection brightened his eyes. He too gazed at the pale
<lb n="06124"/>| disc of the moon, now nearly veiled, and seemed to meditate.
<lb n="06125"/>| <said who="">--</said>She was ... a bit of all right, he said regretfully.</p>
<lb n="06126"/>| <p>He was silent again. Then he added:
<lb n="06127"/>| <said who="">--</said>She's on the turf now. I saw her driving down Earl Street
<lb n="06128"/>| one night with two fellows with her on a car.
<lb n="06129"/>| <said who="">--</said>I suppose that's your doing, said Lenehan.
<lb n="06130"/>| <said who="">--</said>There was others at her before me, said Corley philosophi=
<lb n="06131"/>| cally.</p>
<lb n="06132"/>| <p>This time Lenehan was inclined to disbelieve. He shook his
<lb n="06133"/>| head to and fro and smiled.
<lb n="06134"/>| <said who="">--</said>You know you can't kid me, Corley, he said.
<lb n="06135"/>| <said who="">--</said>Honest to God! said Corley. Didn't she tell me herself?</p>
<lb n="06136"/>| <p>Lenehan made a tragic gesture.
<lb n="06137"/>| <said who="">--</said>Base betrayer! he said.</p>
<lb n="06138"/>| <p>As they passed along by the railings of Trinity College
<lb n="06139"/>| Lenehan skipped out into the road and peered up at the clock:
<lb n="06140"/>| <said who="">--</said>Twenty after, he said.
<lb n="06141"/>| <said who="">--</said>Time enough, said Corley. She'll be there all right. I always
<lb n="06142"/>| let her wait a bit.</p>
<lb n="06143"/>| <p>Lenehan laughed quietly.
<lb n="06144"/>| <said who="">--</said>Ecod, Corley, you know how to take them, he said.
<lb n="06145"/>| <said who="">--</said>I'm up to all their little tricks, Corley confessed.
<lb n="06146"/>| <said who="">--</said>But tell me, said Lenehan again, are you sure you can bring
<lb n="06147"/>| it off all right? You know it's a ticklish job. They're damn close
<lb n="06148"/>| on that point. Eh? ... What?</p>
<lb n="06149"/>| <p>His bright small eyes searched his companion's face for
<lb n="06150"/>| reassurance. Corley swung his head to and fro as if to toss aside
<lb n="06151"/>| an insistent insect, and his brows gathered.
<lb n="06152"/>| <said who="">--</said>I'll pull it off, he said. Leave it to me, can't you?</p>
<lb n="06153"/>| <p>Lenehan said no more. He did not wish to ruffle his friend's
<lb n="06154"/>| temper, to be sent to the devil and told that his advice was not
<lb n="06155"/>| wanted. A little tact was necessary. But Corley's brow was
<lb n="06156"/>| soon smooth again. His thoughts were running another way.
<lb n="06157"/>| <said who="">--</said>She's a fine decent tart, he said with appreciation, that's
<lb n="06158"/>| what she is.</p>
<lb n="06159"/>| <p>They walked along Nassau Street and then turned into
<lb n="06160"/>| Kildare Street. Not far from the porch of the club a harpist
<lb n="06161"/>| stood in the roadway playing to a little ring of listeners. He
<lb n="06162"/>| plucked at the wires heedlessly, glancing quickly from time to
<lb n="06163"/>| time at the face of each newcomer and from time to time,
<lb n="06164"/>| wearily also, at the sky. His harp too, heedless that her
<lb n="06165"/>| coverings had fallen about her knees, seemed weary alike of the
<lb n="06166"/>| eyes of strangers and of her master's hands. One hand played in
<lb n="06167"/>| the bass the melody of <emph>Silent, O Moyle</emph> while the other hand
<lb n="06168"/>| careered in the treble after each group of notes. The notes of
<lb n="06169"/>| the air throbbed deep and full.</p>
<lb n="06170"/>| <p>The two young men walked up the street without speaking,
<lb n="06171"/>| the mournful music following them. When they reached Ste=
<lb n="06172"/>| phen's Green they crossed the road. Here the noise of trams,
<lb n="06173"/>| the lights and the crowd released them from their silence.
<lb n="06174"/>| <said who="">--</said>There she is! said Corley.</p>
<lb n="06175"/>| <p>At the corner of Hume Street a young woman was standing.
<lb n="06176"/>| She wore a blue dress and a white sailor hat. She stood on the
<lb n="06177"/>| curbstone swinging a sunshade in one hand. Lenehan grew
<lb n="06178"/>| lively:
<lb n="06179"/>| <said who="">--</said>Let's have a squint at her, Corley, he said.</p>
<lb n="06180"/>| <p>Corley glanced sideways at his friend and an unpleasant grin
<lb n="06181"/>| appeared on his face.
<lb n="06182"/>| <said who="">--</said>Are you trying to get inside me? he asked.
<lb n="06183"/>| <said who="">--</said>Damn it! said Lenehan boldly, I don't want an introduction.
<lb n="06184"/>| All I want is to have a look at her. I'm not going to eat her.
<lb n="06185"/>| <said who="">--</said>O ... A look at her? said Corley, more amiably. Well. ... I'll
<lb n="06186"/>| tell you what. I'll go over and talk to her and you can pass by.
<lb n="06187"/>| <said who="">--</said>Right! said Lenehan.</p>
<lb n="06188"/>| <p>Corley had already thrown one leg over the chains when
<lb n="06189"/>| Lenehan called out:
<lb n="06190"/>| <said who="">--</said>And after? Where will we meet?
<lb n="06191"/>| <said who="">--</said>Half ten, answered Corley, bringing over his other leg.
<lb n="06192"/>| <said who="">--</said>Where?
<lb n="06193"/>| <said who="">--</said>Corner of Merrion Street. We'll be coming back.
<lb n="06194"/>| <said who="">--</said>Work it all right now, said Lenehan in farewell.</p>
<lb n="06195"/>| <p>Corley did not answer. He sauntered across the road sway=
<lb n="06196"/>| ing his head from side to side. His bulk, his easy pace and the
<lb n="06197"/>| solid sound of his boots had something of the conqueror in
<lb n="06198"/>| them. He approached the young woman and, without saluting,
<lb n="06199"/>| began at once to converse with her. She swung her sunshade
<lb n="06200"/>| more quickly and executed half turns on her heels. Once or
<lb n="06201"/>| twice when he spoke to her at close quarters she laughed and
<lb n="06202"/>| bent her head.</p>
<lb n="06203"/>| <p>Lenehan observed them for a few minutes. Then he walked
<lb n="06204"/>| rapidly along beside the chains to some distance and crossed
<lb n="06205"/>| the road obliquely. As he approached Hume Street corner he
<lb n="06206"/>| found the air heavily scented and his eyes made a swift anxious
<lb n="06207"/>| scrutiny of the young woman's appearance. She had her Sun=
<lb n="06208"/>| day finery on. Her blue serge skirt was held at the waist by a
<lb n="06209"/>| belt of black leather. The great silver buckle of her belt seemed
<lb n="06210"/>| to depress the centre of her body, catching the light stuff of her
<lb n="06211"/>| white blouse like a clip. She wore a short black jacket with
<lb n="06212"/>| mother-of-pearl buttons and a ragged black boa. The ends of
<lb n="06213"/>| her tulle collarette had been carefully disordered and a big
<lb n="06214"/>| bunch of red flowers was pinned in her bosom, stems upwards.
<lb n="06215"/>| Lenehan's eyes noted approvingly her stout short muscular
<lb n="06216"/>| body. Frank rude health glowed in her face, on her fat red
<lb n="06217"/>| cheeks and in her unabashed blue eyes. Her features were
<lb n="06218"/>| blunt. She had broad nostrils, a straggling mouth which lay
<lb n="06219"/>| open in a contented leer and two projecting front teeth. As he
<lb n="06220"/>| passed Lenehan took off his cap and after about ten seconds
<lb n="06221"/>| Corley returned a salute to the air. This he did by raising his
<lb n="06222"/>| hand vaguely and pensively changing the angle of position of
<lb n="06223"/>| his hat.</p>
<lb n="06224"/>| <p>Lenehan walked as far as the Shelbourne Hotel where he
<lb n="06225"/>| halted and waited. After waiting for a little time he saw them
<lb n="06226"/>| coming towards him and when they turned to the right he
<lb n="06227"/>| followed them, stepping lightly in his white shoes, down one
<lb n="06228"/>| side of Merrion Square. As he walked on slowly, timing his
<lb n="06229"/>| pace to theirs, he watched Corley's head which turned at every
<lb n="06230"/>| moment towards the young woman's face like a big ball
<lb n="06231"/>| revolving on a pivot. He kept the pair in view until he had seen
<lb n="06232"/>| them climbing the stairs of the Donnybrook tram; then he
<lb n="06233"/>| turned about and went back the way he had come.</p>
<lb n="06234"/>| <p>Now that he was alone his face looked older. His gaiety
<lb n="06235"/>| seemed to forsake him and, as he came by the railings of the
<lb n="06236"/>| Duke's Lawn, he allowed his hand to run along them. The air
<lb n="06237"/>| which the harpist had played began to control his movements.
<lb n="06238"/>| His softly padded feet played the melody while his fingers
<lb n="06239"/>| swept a scale of variations idly along the railings after each
<lb n="06240"/>| group of notes.</p>
<lb n="06241"/>| <p>He walked listlessly round Stephen's Green and then down
<lb n="06242"/>| Grafton Street. Though his eyes took note of many elements of
<lb n="06243"/>| the crowd through which he passed they did so morosely. He
<lb n="06244"/>| found trivial all that was meant to charm him and did not
<lb n="06245"/>| answer the glances which invited him to be bold. He knew that
<lb n="06246"/>| he would have to speak a great deal, to invent and to amuse,
<lb n="06247"/>| and his brain and throat were too dry for such a task. The
<lb n="06248"/>| problem of how he could pass the hours till he met Corley
<lb n="06249"/>| again troubled him a little. He could think of no way of passing
<lb n="06250"/>| them but to keep on walking. He turned to the left when he
<lb n="06251"/>| came to the corner of Rutland Square and felt more at ease in
<lb n="06252"/>| the dark quiet street, the sombre look of which suited his
<lb n="06253"/>| mood. He paused at last before the window of a poorlooking
<lb n="06254"/>| shop over which the words <emph>Refreshment Bar</emph> were printed in
<lb n="06255"/>| white letters. On the glass of the window were two flying
<lb n="06256"/>| inscriptions: <emph>Ginger Beer</emph> and <emph>Ginger Ale.</emph> A cut ham was
<lb n="06257"/>| exposed on a great blue dish while near it on a plate lay a
<lb n="06258"/>| segment of very light plumpudding. He eyed this food earnestly
<lb n="06259"/>| for some time and then, after glancing warily up and down the
<lb n="06260"/>| street, went into the shop quickly.</p>
<lb n="06261"/>| <p>He was hungry for, except some biscuits which he had asked
<lb n="06262"/>| two grudging curates to bring him, he had eaten nothing since
<lb n="06263"/>| breakfast-time. He sat down at an uncovered wooden table
<lb n="06264"/>| opposite two work girls and a mechanic. A slatternly girl
<lb n="06265"/>| waited on him.
<lb n="06266"/>| <said who="">--</said>How much is a plate of peas? he asked.
<lb n="06267"/>| <said who="">--</said>Three halfpence, sir, said the girl.
<lb n="06268"/>| <said who="">--</said>Bring me a plate of peas, he said, and a bottle of ginger beer.</p>
<lb n="06269"/>| <p>He spoke roughly in order to belie his air of gentility for his
<lb n="06270"/>| entry had been followed by a pause of talk. His face was
<lb n="06271"/>| heated. To appear natural he pushed his cap back on his head
<lb n="06272"/>| and planted his elbows on the table. The mechanic and the two
<lb n="06273"/>| work girls examined him point by point before resuming their
<lb n="06274"/>| conversation in a subdued voice. The girl brought him a plate
<lb n="06275"/>| of hot grocer's peas seasoned with pepper and vinegar, a fork
<lb n="06276"/>| and his ginger beer. He ate his food greedily and found it so
<lb n="06277"/>| good that he made a note of the shop mentally. When he had
<lb n="06278"/>| eaten all the peas he sipped his ginger beer and sat for some
<lb n="06279"/>| time thinking of Corley's adventure. In his imagination he
<lb n="06280"/>| beheld the pair of lovers walking along some dark road, he
<lb n="06281"/>| heard Corley's voice in deep energetic gallantries and saw again
<lb n="06282"/>| the leer of the young woman's mouth. This vision made him
<lb n="06283"/>| feel keenly his own poverty of purse and spirit. He was tired of
<lb n="06284"/>| knocking about, of pulling the devil by the tail, of shifts and
<lb n="06285"/>| intrigues. He would be thirty-one in November. Would he
<lb n="06286"/>| never get a good job? Would he never have a home of his own?
<lb n="06287"/>| He thought how pleasant it would be to have a warm fire to sit
<lb n="06288"/>| by and a good dinner to sit down to. He had walked the streets
<lb n="06289"/>| long enough with friends and with girls. He knew what those
<lb n="06290"/>| friends were worth: he knew the girls too. Experience had
<lb n="06291"/>| embittered his heart against the world. But all hope had not left
<lb n="06292"/>| him. He felt better after having eaten than he had felt before,
<lb n="06293"/>| less weary of his life, less vanquished in spirit. He might yet be
<lb n="06294"/>| able to settle down in some snug corner and live happily if he
<lb n="06295"/>| could only come across some good simpleminded girl with a
<lb n="06296"/>| little of the ready.</p>
<lb n="06297"/>| <p>He paid twopence halfpenny to the slatternly girl and went
<lb n="06298"/>| out of the shop to begin his wandering again. He went into
<lb n="06299"/>| Capel Street and walked along towards the City Hall. Then he
<lb n="06300"/>| turned into Dame Street. At the corner of George's Street he
<lb n="06301"/>| met two friends of his and stopped to converse with them. He
<lb n="06302"/>| was glad that he could rest from all his walking. His friends
<lb n="06303"/>| asked him had he seen Corley and what was the latest. He
<lb n="06304"/>| replied that he had spent the day with Corley. His friends
<lb n="06305"/>| talked very little. They looked vacantly after some figures in
<lb n="06306"/>| the crowd and sometimes made a critical remark. One said that
<lb n="06307"/>| he had seen Mac an hour before in Westmoreland Street. At
<lb n="06308"/>| this Lenehan said that he had been with Mac the night before
<lb n="06309"/>| in Egan's. The young man who had seen Mac in Westmoreland
<lb n="06310"/>| Street asked was it true that Mac had won a bit over a billiard
<lb n="06311"/>| match. Lenehan did not know: he said that Holohan had stood
<lb n="06312"/>| them drinks in Egan's.</p>
<lb n="06313"/>| <p>He left his friends at a quarter to ten and went up George's
<lb n="06314"/>| Street. He turned to the left at the City Markets and walked on
<lb n="06315"/>| into Grafton Street. The crowd of girls and young men had
<lb n="06316"/>| thinned and on his way up the street he heard many groups and
<lb n="06317"/>| couples bidding one another goodnight. He went as far as the
<lb n="06318"/>| clock of the College of Surgeons: it was on the stroke of ten. He
<lb n="06319"/>| set off briskly along the northern side of the Green, hurrying
<lb n="06320"/>| for fear Corley should return too soon. When he reached the
<lb n="06321"/>| corner of Merrion Street he took his stand in the shadow of a
<lb n="06322"/>| lamp and brought out one of the cigarettes which he had
<lb n="06323"/>| reserved and lit it. He leaned against the lamppost and kept his
<lb n="06324"/>| gaze fixed on the part from which he expected to see Corley
<lb n="06325"/>| and the young woman return.</p>
<lb n="06326"/>| <p>His mind became active again. He wondered had Corley
<lb n="06327"/>| managed it successfully. He wondered if he had asked her yet
<lb n="06328"/>| or if he would leave it to the last. He suffered all the pangs and
<lb n="06329"/>| thrills of his friend's situation as well as those of his own. But
<lb n="06330"/>| the memory of Corley's slowly revolving head calmed him
<lb n="06331"/>| somewhat: he was sure Corley would pull it off all right. All at
<lb n="06332"/>| once the idea struck him that perhaps Corley had seen her
<lb n="06333"/>| home by another way and given him the slip. His eyes searched
<lb n="06334"/>| the street: there was no sign of them. Yet it was surely half an
<lb n="06335"/>| hour since he had seen the clock of the College of Surgeons.
<lb n="06336"/>| Would Corley do a thing like that? He lit his last cigarette and
<lb n="06337"/>| began to smoke it nervously. He strained his eyes as each tram
<lb n="06338"/>| stopped at the far corner of the square. They must have gone
<lb n="06339"/>| home by another way. The paper of his cigarette broke and he
<lb n="06340"/>| flung it into the road with a curse.</p>
<lb n="06341"/>| <p>Suddenly he saw them coming towards him. He started with
<lb n="06342"/>| delight and, keeping close to his lamppost, tried to read the
<lb n="06343"/>| result in their walk. They were walking quickly, the young
<lb n="06344"/>| woman taking quick short steps while Corley kept beside her
<lb n="06345"/>| with his long stride. They did not seem to be speaking. An
<lb n="06346"/>| intimation of the result pricked him like the point of a sharp
<lb n="06347"/>| instrument. He knew Corley would fail: he knew it was no go.</p>
<lb n="06348"/>| <p>They turned down Baggot Street and he followed them at
<lb n="06349"/>| once, taking the other footpath. When they stopped he stopped
<lb n="06350"/>| too. They talked for a few moments and then the young
<lb n="06351"/>| woman went down the steps into the area of a house. Corley
<lb n="06352"/>| remained standing at the edge of the path, a little distance from
<lb n="06353"/>| the front steps. Some minutes passed. Then the halldoor was
<lb n="06354"/>| opened slowly and cautiously. A woman came running down
<lb n="06355"/>| the front steps and coughed. Corley turned and went towards
<lb n="06356"/>| her. His broad figure hid hers from view for a few seconds and
<lb n="06357"/>| then she reappeared running up the steps. The door closed on
<lb n="06358"/>| her and Corley began to walk swiftly towards Stephen's Green.</p>
<lb n="06359"/>| <p>Lenehan hurried on in the same direction. Some drops of
<lb n="06360"/>| light rain fell. He took them as a warning and, glancing back
<lb n="06361"/>| towards the house which the young woman had entered to see
<lb n="06362"/>| that he was not observed, he ran eagerly across the road.
<lb n="06363"/>| Anxiety and his swift run made him pant. He called out:
<lb n="06364"/>| <said who="">--</said>Hello, Corley!</p>
<lb n="06365"/>| <p>Corley turned his head to see who had called him and then
<lb n="06366"/>| continued walking as before. Lenehan ran after him, settling
<lb n="06367"/>| the waterproof on his shoulders with one hand.
<lb n="06368"/>| <said who="">--</said>Hello, Corley! he cried again.</p>
<lb n="06369"/>| <p>He came level with his friend and looked keenly in his face.
<lb n="06370"/>| He could see nothing there.
<lb n="06371"/>| <said who="">--</said>Well? he said. Did it come off?</p>
<lb n="06372"/>| <p>They had reached the corner of Ely Place. Still without
<lb n="06373"/>| answering Corley swerved to the left and went up the side
<lb n="06374"/>| street. His features were composed in stern calm. Lenehan kept
<lb n="06375"/>| up with his friend, breathing uneasily. He was baffled and a
<lb n="06376"/>| note of menace pierced through his voice.
<lb n="06377"/>| <said who="">--</said>Can't you tell us? he said. Did you try her?</p>
<lb n="06378"/>| <p>Corley halted at the first lamp and stared grimly before him.
<lb n="06379"/>| Then with a grave gesture he extended a hand towards the light
<lb n="06380"/>| and, smiling, opened it slowly to the gaze of his disciple. A
<lb n="06381"/>| small gold coin shone in the palm.</p>
