<lb n="04001"/> <p>She sat at the window watching the evening invade the av=
<lb n="04002"/> enue. Her head was leaned against the window curtains and in
<lb n="04003"/> her nostrils was the odour of dusty cretonne. She was tired.</p>
<lb n="04004"/> <p>Few people passed. The man out of the last house passed on
<lb n="04005"/> his way home; she heard his footsteps clacking along the
<lb n="04006"/> concrete pavement and afterwards crunching on the cinder
<lb n="04007"/> path before the new red houses. One time there used to be a
<lb n="04008"/> field there in which they used to play every evening with other
<lb n="04009"/> people's children. Then a man from Belfast bought the field
<lb n="04010"/> and built houses in it - not like their little brown houses but
<lb n="04011"/> bright brick houses with shining roofs. The children of the
<lb n="04012"/> avenue used to play together in that field - the Devines, the
<lb n="04013"/> Waters, the Dunns, little Keogh the cripple, she and her
  <lb n="04014"/> brothers and sisters. <persName xml:id="er">Ernest</persName>, however, never played: he was too
<lb n="04015"/> grown up. Her father used often to hunt them in out of the
<lb n="04016"/> field with his blackthorn stick but usually little <persName xml:id="ke">Keogh</persName> used to
<lb n="04017"/> keep nix and call out when he saw her father coming. Still they
<lb n="04018"/> seemed to have been rather happy then. Her father was not so
<lb n="04019"/> bad then, and besides her mother was alive. That was a long
<lb n="04020"/> time ago; she and her brothers and sisters were all grown up;
  <lb n="04021"/> her mother was dead. <persName xml:id="td">Tizzie Dunn</persName> was dead, too, and the
<lb n="04022"/> Waters had gone back to England. Everything changes. Now
<lb n="04023"/> she was going to go away like the others, to leave her home.</p>
<lb n="04024"/> <p>Home! She looked round the room reviewing all its familiar
<lb n="04025"/> objects which she had dusted once a week for so many years,
<lb n="04026"/> wondering where on earth all the dust came from. Perhaps she
<lb n="04027"/> would never see again those familiar objects from which she
<lb n="04028"/> had never dreamed of being divided. And yet during all those
<lb n="04029"/> years she had never found out the name of the priest whose
<lb n="04030"/> yellowing photograph hung on the wall above the broken
<lb n="04031"/> harmonium beside the coloured print of the promises made to
<lb n="04032"/> Blessed Margaret Mary Alacoque. He had been a school friend
<lb n="04033"/> of her father's. Whenever he showed the photograph to a
<lb n="04034"/> visitor her father used to pass it with a casual word:
<lb n="04035"/> <said who="Eveline's father">―He is in Melbourne now.</said></p>
<lb n="04036"/> <p>She had consented to go away, to leave her home. Was that
<lb n="04037"/> wise? She tried to weigh each side of the question. In her home
<lb n="04038"/> anyway she had shelter and food; she had those whom she had
<lb n="04039"/> known all her life about her. Of course she had to work hard
<lb n="04040"/> both in the house and at business. What would they say of her
<lb n="04041"/> in the stores when they found out that she had run away with a
<lb n="04042"/> fellow? Say she was a fool, perhaps; and her place would be
  <lb n="04043"/> filled up by advertisement. <persName xml:id="msg">Miss Gavan</persName> would be glad. She had
<lb n="04044"/> always had an edge on her, especially whenever there were
<lb n="04045"/> people listening.
  <lb n="04046"/> <said who="Miss Gavan">―<persName xml:id="msh">Miss Hill</persName>, don't you see these ladies are waiting?</said>
  <lb n="04047"/> <said who="Miss Gavan">―Look lively, <persName xml:id="msh">Miss Hill</persName>, please.</said></p>
<lb n="04048"/> <p>She would not cry many tears at leaving the stores.</p>
<lb n="04049"/> <p>But in her new home, in a distant unknown country, it
<lb n="04050"/> would not be like that. Then she would be married- she,
  <lb n="04051"/> <persName xml:id="ev">Eveline</persName>. People would treat her with respect then. She would
<lb n="04052"/> not be treated as her mother had been. Even now, though she
<lb n="04053"/> was over nineteen, she sometimes felt herself in danger of her
<lb n="04054"/> father's violence. She knew it was that that had given her the
<lb n="04055"/> palpitations. When they were growing up he had never gone
  <lb n="04056"/> for her, like he used to go for <persName xml:id="ha">Harry</persName> and <persName xml:id="er">Ernest</persName>, because she
<lb n="04057"/> was a girl; but latterly he had begun to threaten her and say
<lb n="04058"/> what he would do to her only for her dead mother's sake. And
  <lb n="04059"/> now she had nobody to protect her. <persName xml:id="er">Ernest</persName> was dead and
  <lb n="04060"/> <persName xml:id="ha">Harry</persName>, who was in the church decorating business, was nearly
<lb n="04061"/> always down somewhere in the country. Besides, the invariable
<lb n="04062"/> squabble for money on Saturday nights had begun to weary her
<lb n="04063"/> unspeakably. She always gave her entire wages - seven shillings
  <lb n="04064"/> - and <persName xml:id="ha">Harry</persName> always sent up what he could but the trouble was
<lb n="04065"/> to get any money from her father. He said she used to squander
<lb n="04066"/> the money, that she had no head, that he wasn't going to give
<lb n="04067"/> her his hard earned money to throw about the streets and much
<lb n="04068"/> more for he was usually fairly bad of a Saturday night. In the
<lb n="04069"/> end he would give her the money and ask her had she any
<lb n="04070"/> intention of buying Sunday's dinner. Then she had to rush out
<lb n="04071"/> as quickly as she could and do her marketing, holding her black
<lb n="04072"/> leather purse tightly in her hand as she elbowed her way
<lb n="04073"/> through the crowds and returning home late under her load of
<lb n="04074"/> provisions. She had hard work to keep the house together and
<lb n="04075"/> to see that the two young children who had been left to her
<lb n="04076"/> charge went to school regularly and got their meals regularly. It
<lb n="04077"/> was hard work - a hard life - but now that she was about to
<lb n="04078"/> leave it she did not find it a wholly undesirable life.</p>
  <lb n="04079"/> <p>She was about to explore another life with <persName xml:id="fr">Frank</persName>. <persName xml:id="fr">Frank</persName> was
<lb n="04080"/> very kind, manly, openhearted. She was to go away with him
<lb n="04081"/> by the night boat to be his wife and to live with him in Buenos
<lb n="04082"/> Ayres where he had a home waiting for her. How well she
<lb n="04083"/> remembered the first time she had seen him; he was lodging in
<lb n="04084"/> a house on the main road where she used to visit. It seemed a
<lb n="04085"/> few weeks ago. He was standing at the gate, his peaked cap
<lb n="04086"/> pushed back on his head and his hair tumbled forward over a
<lb n="04087"/> face of bronze. Then they had come to know each other. He
<lb n="04088"/> used to meet her outside the stores every evening and see her
<lb n="04089"/> home. He took her to see the <emph>Bohemian Girl</emph> and she felt elated
<lb n="04090"/> as she sat in an unaccustomed part of the theatre with him. He
<lb n="04091"/> was awfully fond of music and sang a little. People knew that
<lb n="04092"/> they were courting and when he sang about the lass that loves a
<lb n="04093"/> sailor she always felt pleasantly confused. He used to call her
<lb n="04094"/> Poppens out of fun. First of all it had been an excitement for
<lb n="04095"/> her to have a fellow and then she had begun to like him. He
<lb n="04096"/> had tales of distant countries. He had started as a deck boy at a
<lb n="04097"/> pound a month on a ship of the Allan line going out to Canada.
<lb n="04098"/> He told her the names of the ships he had been on and the
<lb n="04099"/> names of the different services. He had sailed through the
<lb n="04100"/> Straits of Magellan and he told her stories of the terrible
<lb n="04101"/> Patagonians. He had fallen on his feet in Buenos Ayres, he said,
<lb n="04102"/> and had come over to the old country just for a holiday. Of
<lb n="04103"/> course, her father had found out the affair and had forbidden
<lb n="04104"/> her to have anything to say to him:
<lb n="04105"/> <said who="Eveline's father">―I know these sailor chaps, he said.</said></p>
  <lb n="04106"/> <p>One day he had quarrelled with <persName xml:id="fr">Frank</persName> and after that she had
<lb n="04107"/> to meet her lover secretly.</p>
<lb n="04108"/> <p>The evening deepened in the avenue. The white of two let=
  <lb n="04109"/> ters in her lap grew indistinct. One was to <persName xml:id="ha">Harry</persName>, the other was
  <lb n="04110"/> to her father. <persName xml:id="er">Ernest</persName> had been her favourite but she liked <persName xml:id="ha">Harry</persName>
<lb n="04111"/> too. Her father was becoming old lately, she noticed; he would
<lb n="04112"/> miss her. Sometimes he could be very nice. Not long before,
<lb n="04113"/> when she had been laid up for a day, he had read her out a
<lb n="04114"/> ghost story and made toast for her at the fire. Another day,
<lb n="04115"/> when their mother was alive, they had all gone for a picnic to
<lb n="04116"/> the Hill of Howth. She remembered her father putting on her
<lb n="04117"/> mother's bonnet to make the children laugh.</p>
<lb n="04118"/> <p>Her time was running out but she continued to sit by the
<lb n="04119"/> window, leaning her head against the window curtain, inhaling
<lb n="04120"/> the odour of dusty cretonne. Down far in the avenue she could
<lb n="04121"/> hear a street organ playing. She knew the air. Strange that it
<lb n="04122"/> should come that very night to remind her of the promise to her
<lb n="04123"/> mother, her promise to keep the home together as long as she
<lb n="04124"/> could. She remembered the last night of her mother's illness;
<lb n="04125"/> she was again in the close dark room at the other side of the
<lb n="04126"/> hall and outside she heard a melancholy air of Italy. The organ
<lb n="04127"/> player had been ordered to go away and given sixpence. She
<lb n="04128"/> remembered her father strutting back into the sickroom saying:
<lb n="04129"/> <said who="Eveline's Father">―Damned Italians! coming over here!</said></p>
<lb n="04130"/> <p>As she mused the pitiful vision of her mother's life laid its
<lb n="04131"/> spell on the very quick of her being - that life of commonplace
<lb n="04132"/> sacrifices closing in final craziness. She trembled as she heard
<lb n="04133"/> again her mother's voice saying constantly with foolish insis=
<lb n="04134"/> tence:
<lb n="04135"/> <said who="Eveline's mother">―Derevaun Seraun! Derevaun Seraun!</said></p>
<lb n="04136"/> <p>She stood up in a sudden impulse of terror. Escape! She must
  <lb n="04137"/> escape! <persName xml:id="fr">Frank</persName> would save her. He would give her life, perhaps
<lb n="04138"/> love too. But she wanted to live. Why should she be unhappy?
  <lb n="04139"/> She had a right to happiness. <persName xml:id="fr">Frank</persName> would take her in his arms,
<lb n="04140"/> fold her in his arms. He would save her.</p>
<lb /> *  *  *
<lb n="04141"/> <p>She stood among the swaying crowd in the station at the
<lb n="04142"/> North Wall. He held her hand and she knew that he was speak=
<lb n="04143"/> ing to her, saying something about the passage over and over
<lb n="04144"/> again. The station was full of soldiers with brown baggages.
<lb n="04145"/> Through the wide doors of the sheds she caught a glimpse of
<lb n="04146"/> the black mass of the boat lying in beside the quay wall, with
<lb n="04147"/> illumined portholes. She answered nothing. She felt her cheek
<lb n="04148"/> pale and cold and out of a maze of distress she prayed to God
<lb n="04149"/> to direct her, to show her what was her duty. The boat blew a
<lb n="04150"/> long mournful whistle into the mist. If she went, tomorrow she
  <lb n="04151"/> would be on the sea with <persName xml:id="fr">Frank</persName>, steaming towards Buenos
<lb n="04152"/> Ayres. Their passage had been booked. Could she still draw
<lb n="04153"/> back after all he had done for her? Her distress awoke a nausea
<lb n="04154"/> in her body and she kept moving her lips in silent fervent
<lb n="04155"/> prayer.</p>
<lb n="04156"/> <p>A bell clanged upon her heart. She felt him seize her hand:
<lb n="04157"/> <said who="Frank">―Come!</said></p>
<lb n="04158"/> <p>All the seas of the world tumbled about her heart. He was
<lb n="04159"/> drawing her into them: he would drown her. She gripped with
<lb n="04160"/> both hands at the iron railing.
<lb n="04161"/> <said who="Frank">―Come!</said></p>
<lb n="04162"/> <p>No! No! No! It was impossible. Her hands clutched the iron
<lb n="04163"/> in frenzy. Amid the seas she sent a cry of anguish.
  <lb n="04164"/> <said who="Frank">―<persName xml:id="ev">Eveline</persName>! <persName xml:id="ev">Evvy</persName>!</said></p>
<lb n="04165"/> <p>He rushed beyond the barrier and called to her to follow. He
<lb n="04166"/> was shouted at to go on but he still called to her. She set her
<lb n="04167"/> white face to him, passive, like a helpless animal. Her eyes gave
<lb n="04168"/> him no sign of love or farewell or recognition.</p>
