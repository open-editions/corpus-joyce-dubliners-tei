  <lb n="09001"/> <p>The bell rang furiously and, when <persName xml:id="mp">Miss Parker</persName> went to the
<lb n="09002"/> tube, a furious voice called out in a piercing north of Ireland
<lb n="09003"/> accent:
  <lb n="09004"/> <said who="Mr Alleyne">―Send <persName xml:id="fn">Farrington</persName> here!</said></p>
  <lb n="09005"/> <p><persName xml:id="mp">Miss Parker</persName> returned to her machine, saying to a man who
<lb n="09006"/> was writing at a desk:
  <lb n="09007"/> <said who="Miss Parker">―<persName xml:id="ma">Mr Alleyne</persName> wants you upstairs.</said></p>
<lb n="09008"/> <p>The man muttered <emph>Blast him!</emph> under his breath and pushed
<lb n="09009"/> back his chair to stand up. When he stood up he was tall and of
<lb n="09010"/> great bulk. He had a hanging face, dark winecoloured, with fair
<lb n="09011"/> eyebrows and moustache; his eyes bulged forward slightly and
<lb n="09012"/> the whites of them were dirty. He lifted up the counter and,
<lb n="09013"/> passing by the clients, went out of the office with a heavy step.</p>
<lb n="09014"/> <p>He went heavily upstairs until he came to the second landing
<lb n="09015"/> where a door bore a brass plate with the inscription <emph><persName xml:id="ma">Mr
  <lb n="09016"/> Alleyne</persName>.</emph> Here he halted puffing with labour and vexation and
<lb n="09017"/> knocked. The shrill voice cried:
<lb n="09018"/> <said who="Mr Alleyne">―Come in!</said></p>
  <lb n="09019"/> <p>The man entered <persName xml:id="ma">Mr Alleyne</persName>'s room. Simultaneously <persName xml:id="ma">Mr
  <lb n="09020"/> Alleyne</persName>, a little man wearing goldrimmed glasses on a clean=
<lb n="09021"/> shaven face, shot his head up over a pile of documents. The
<lb n="09022"/> head itself was so pink and hairless that it seemed like a large
  <lb n="09023"/> egg reposing on the papers. <persName xml:id="ma">Mr Alleyne</persName> did not lose a moment:
  <lb n="09024"/> <said who="Mr Alleyne">―<persName xml:id="fn">Farrington</persName>! What is the meaning of this? Why have I always
<lb n="09025"/> to complain of you? May I ask you why you haven't made a
  <lb n="09026"/> copy of that contract between <persName xml:id="bo">Bodley</persName> and <persName xml:id="ki">Kirwan</persName>? I told you it
<lb n="09027"/> must be ready by four o'clock.</said>
  <lb n="09028"/> <said who="Farrington">―But <persName xml:id="msh">Mr Shelley</persName> said, sir, .....</said>
  <lb n="09029"/> <said who="Mr Alleyne">―<emph><persName xml:id="msh">Mr Shelley</persName> said, sir.</emph> ..... Kindly attend to what I say and not
  <lb n="09030"/> to what <emph><persName xml:id="msh">Mr Shelley</persName> says, sir.</emph> You have always some excuse or
<lb n="09031"/> another for shirking work. Let me tell you that if the contract is
<lb n="09032"/> not copied before this evening I'll lay the matter before <persName xml:id="mc">Mr
  <lb n="09033"/> Crosbie</persName> ... Do you hear me now?</said>
<lb n="09034"/> <said who="Farrington">―Yes, sir.</said>
<lb n="09035"/> <said who="Mr Alleyne">―Do you hear me now? ......... Aye and another little matter! I
<lb n="09036"/> might as well be talking to the wall as talking to you. Under=
<lb n="09037"/> stand once for all that you get a half an hour for your lunch
<lb n="09038"/> and not an hour and a half. How many courses do you want,
<lb n="09039"/> I'd like to know? ... Do you mind me, now?</said>
<lb n="09040"/> <said who="Farrington">―Yes, sir.</said></p>
  <lb n="09041"/> <p><persName xml:id="ma">Mr Alleyne</persName> bent his head again upon his pile of papers. The
<lb n="09042"/> man stared fixedly at the polished skull which directed the
  <lb n="09043"/> affairs of <persName xml:id="mc">Crosbie</persName> and <persName xml:id="ma">Alleyne</persName>, gauging its fragility. A spasm of
<lb n="09044"/> rage gripped his throat for a few moments and then passed,
<lb n="09045"/> leaving after it a sharp sensation of thirst. The man recognised
<lb n="09046"/> the sensation and felt that he must have a good night's drink=
<lb n="09047"/> ing. The middle of the month was past and, if he could get the
  <lb n="09048"/> copy done in time, <persName xml:id="ma">Mr Alleyne</persName> might give him an order on the
<lb n="09049"/> cashier. He stood still, gazing fixedly at the head upon the pile
  <lb n="09050"/> of papers. Suddenly <persName xml:id="ma">Mr Alleyne</persName> began to upset all the papers,
<lb n="09051"/> searching for something. Then, as if he had been unaware of
<lb n="09052"/> the man's presence till that moment, he shot up his head again,
<lb n="09053"/> saying:
<lb n="09054"/> <said who="Mr Alleyne">―Eh! Are you going to stand there all the day? Upon my word,
  <lb n="09055"/> <persName xml:id="fn">Farrington</persName>, you take things easy!</said>
<lb n="09056"/> <said who="Farrington">―I was waiting to see. ....</said>
<lb n="09057"/> <said who="Mr Alleyne">―Very good, you needn't wait to see. Go downstairs and do
<lb n="09058"/> your work.</said></p>
<lb n="09059"/> <p>The man walked heavily towards the door and as he went
  <lb n="09060"/> out of the room he heard <persName xml:id="ma">Mr Alleyne</persName> cry after him that if the
  <lb n="09061"/> contract was not copied by evening <persName xml:id="mc">Mr Crosbie</persName> would hear of
<lb n="09062"/> the matter.</p>
<lb n="09063"/> <p>He returned to his desk in the lower office and counted the
<lb n="09064"/> sheets which remained to be copied. He took up his pen and
<lb n="09065"/> dipped it in the ink but he continued to stare stupidly at the last
<lb n="09066"/> words he had written: <emph>In no case shall the said <persName xml:id="bo">Bernard Bodley</persName>
<lb n="09067"/> be</emph> ...... The evening was falling and in a few minutes they
<lb n="09068"/> would be lighting the gas: then he could write. He felt that he
<lb n="09069"/> must slake the thirst in his throat. He stood up from his desk
<lb n="09070"/> and, lifting the counter as before, passed out of the office. As
<lb n="09071"/> he was passing out the chief clerk looked at him inquiringly.
  <lb n="09072"/> <said who="Farrington">―It's all right, <persName xml:id="msh">Mr Shelley</persName>, </said>said the man pointing with his
<lb n="09073"/> finger to indicate the objective of his journey.</p>
<lb n="09074"/> <p>The chief clerk glanced at the hatrack but, seeing the row
<lb n="09075"/> complete, offered no remark. As soon as he was on the landing
<lb n="09076"/> the man pulled a shepherd's plaid cap out of his pocket, put it
<lb n="09077"/> on his head and ran quickly down the rickety stairs. From the
<lb n="09078"/> street door he walked on furtively on the inner side of the path
<lb n="09079"/> towards the corner and all at once dived into a doorway. He
<lb n="09080"/> was now safe in the dark snug of O'Neill's shop and, filling up
<lb n="09081"/> the little window that looked into the bar with his inflamed
<lb n="09082"/> face, the colour of dark wine or dark meat, he called out:
  <lb n="09083"/> <said who="Farrington">―Here, <persName xml:id="pt">Pat</persName>, give us a g.p., like a good fellow!</said></p>
<lb n="09084"/> <p>The curate brought him a glass of plain porter. The man
<lb n="09085"/> drank it at a gulp and asked for a caraway seed. He put his
<lb n="09086"/> penny on the counter and, leaving the curate to grope for it in
<lb n="09087"/> the gloom, retreated out of the snug as furtively as he had
<lb n="09088"/> entered it.</p>
<lb n="09089"/> <p>Darkness, accompanied by a thick fog, was gaining upon the
<lb n="09090"/> dusk of February and the lamps in Eustace Street had been lit.
<lb n="09091"/> The man went up by the houses until he reached the door of
<lb n="09092"/> the office, wondering whether he could finish his copy in time.
<lb n="09093"/> On the stairs a moist pungent odour of perfumes saluted his
  <lb n="09094"/> nose: evidently <persName xml:id="md">Miss Delacour</persName> had come while he was out in
<lb n="09095"/> O'Neill's. He crammed his cap back again into his pocket and
<lb n="09096"/> reentered the office, assuming an air of absentmindedness.
  <lb n="09097"/> <said who="Mr Shelley">―<persName xml:id="ma">Mr Alleyne</persName> has been calling for you, </said>said the chief clerk
<lb n="09098"/> severely. <said who="Mr Shelley">Where were you?</said></p>
<lb n="09099"/> <p>The man glanced at the two clients who were standing at the
<lb n="09100"/> counter as if to intimate that their presence prevented him from
<lb n="09101"/> answering. As the clients were both male the chief clerk
<lb n="09102"/> allowed himself a laugh:
  <lb n="09103"/> <said who="Mr Shelley">―I know that game, </said>he said. <said who="Mr Shelley">Five times in one day is a little
<lb n="09104"/> bit ..... Well, you better look sharp and get a copy of our
  <lb n="09105"/> correspondence in the <persName xml:id="md">Delacour</persName> case for <persName xml:id="ma">Mr Alleyne</persName>.</said></p>
<lb n="09106"/> <p>This address in the presence of the public, his run upstairs
<lb n="09107"/> and the porter he had gulped down so hastily confused the man
<lb n="09108"/> and, as he sat down at his desk to get what was required, he
<lb n="09109"/> realised how hopeless was the task of finishing his copy of the
<lb n="09110"/> contract before half past five. The dark damp night was
<lb n="09111"/> coming and he longed to spend it in the bars, drinking with his
<lb n="09112"/> friends amid the glare of gas and the clatter of glasses. He got
  <lb n="09113"/> out the <persName xml:id="md">Delacour</persName> correspondence and passed out of the office.
  <lb n="09114"/> He hoped <persName xml:id="ma">Mr Alleyne</persName> would not discover that the last two
<lb n="09115"/> letters were missing.</p>
<lb n="09116"/> <p>The moist pungent perfume lay all the way up to <persName xml:id="ma">Mr
  <lb n="09117"/> Alleyne</persName>'s room. <persName xml:id="md">Miss Delacour</persName> was a middleaged woman of
  <lb n="09118"/> Jewish appearance. <persName xml:id="ma">Mr Alleyne</persName> was said to be sweet on her or
<lb n="09119"/> on her money. She came to the office often and stayed a long
<lb n="09120"/> time when she came. She was sitting beside his desk now in an
<lb n="09121"/> aroma of perfumes, smoothing the handle of her umbrella and
<lb n="09122"/> nodding the great black feather in her hat. <persName xml:id="ma">Mr Alleyne</persName> had
<lb n="09123"/> swivelled his chair round to face her and thrown his right foot
<lb n="09124"/> jauntily upon his left knee. The man put the correspondence on
<lb n="09125"/> the desk and bowed respectfully but neither <persName xml:id="ma">Mr Alleyne</persName> nor
  <lb n="09126"/> <persName xml:id="md">Miss Delacour</persName> took any notice of his bow. <persName xml:id="ma">Mr Alleyne</persName> tapped
<lb n="09127"/> a finger on the correspondence and then flicked it towards him
<lb n="09128"/> as if to say <emph>That's all right: you can go.</emph></p>
<lb n="09129"/> <p>The man returned to the lower office and sat down again at
<lb n="09130"/> his desk. He stared intently at the incomplete phrase <emph>In no case
  <lb n="09131"/> shall the said <persName xml:id="bo">Bernard Bodley</persName> be</emph> .... and thought how strange it
<lb n="09132"/> was that the last three words began with the same letter. The
  <lb n="09133"/> chief clerk began to harry <persName xml:id="mp">Miss Parker</persName>, saying she would never
<lb n="09134"/> have the letters typed in time for post. The man listened to the
<lb n="09135"/> clicking of the machine for a few minutes and then set to work
<lb n="09136"/> to finish his copy. But his head was not clear and his mind
<lb n="09137"/> wandered away to the glare and rattle of the publichouse. It
<lb n="09138"/> was a night for hot punches. He struggled on with his copy but
<lb n="09139"/> when the clock struck five he had still fourteen pages to write.
  <lb n="09140"/> <said who="Farrington" aloud="false">Blast it! </said>He couldn't finish it in time. He longed to execrate
<lb n="09141"/> aloud, to bring his fist down on something violently. He was so
  <lb n="09142"/> enraged that he wrote <emph><persName xml:id="bo">Bernard Bernard</persName></emph> instead of <emph><persName xml:id="bo">Bernard
  <lb n="09143"/> Bodley</persName></emph> and had to begin again on a clean sheet.</p>
<lb n="09144"/> <p>He felt strong enough to clear out the whole office single=
<lb n="09145"/> handed. His body ached to do something, to rush out and revel
<lb n="09146"/> in violence. All the indignities of his life enraged him. ... Could
<lb n="09147"/> he ask the cashier privately for an advance? No, the cashier was
<lb n="09148"/> no good, no damn good: he wouldn't give an advance. ...... He
  <lb n="09149"/> knew where he would meet the boys: <persName xml:id="ld">Leonard</persName> and <persName xml:id="on">O'Halloran</persName>
  <lb n="09150"/> and <persName xml:id="nf">Nosey Flynn</persName>. The barometer of his emotional nature was
<lb n="09151"/> set for a spell of riot.</p>
<lb n="09152"/> <p>His imagination had so abstracted him that his name was
  <lb n="09153"/> called twice before he answered. <persName xml:id="ma">Mr Alleyne</persName> and <persName xml:id="md">Miss Dela=
  <lb n="09154"/> cour</persName> were standing outside the counter and all the clerks had
<lb n="09155"/> turned round in anticipation of something. The man got up
  <lb n="09156"/> from his desk. <persName xml:id="ma">Mr Alleyne</persName> began a tirade of abuse, saying that
<lb n="09157"/> two letters were missing. The man answered that he knew
<lb n="09158"/> nothing about them, that he had made a faithful copy. The
<lb n="09159"/> tirade continued: it was so bitter and violent that the man
<lb n="09160"/> could hardly restrain his fist from descending upon the head of
<lb n="09161"/> the manikin before him:
  <lb n="09162"/> <said who="Farrington">―I know nothing about any other two letters, </said>he said stupidly.
<lb n="09163"/> <said who="Mr Alleyne">―<emph>You-know-nothing.</emph> Of course you know nothing, </said>said
  <lb n="09164"/> <persName xml:id="ma">Mr Alleyne</persName>. <said who="Mr Alleyne">Tell me, </said>he added, glancing first for approval to
<lb n="09165"/> the lady beside him, <said who="Mr Alleyne">do you take me for a fool? Do you think
<lb n="09166"/> me an utter fool?</said></p>
<lb n="09167"/> <p>The man glanced from the lady's face to the little eggshaped
<lb n="09168"/> head and back again: and almost before he was aware of it his
<lb n="09169"/> tongue had found a felicitous moment:
  <lb n="09170"/> <said who="Farrington">―I don't think, sir, </said>he said, <said who="Farrington">that that's a fair question to put
<lb n="09171"/> to me.</said></p>
<lb n="09172"/> <p>There was a pause in the very breathing of the clerks. Every=
<lb n="09173"/> one was astounded (the author of the witticism no less than his
  <lb n="09174"/> neighbours) and <persName xml:id="md">Miss Delacour</persName>, who was a stout amiable per=
  <lb n="09175"/> son, began to smile broadly. <persName xml:id="ma">Mr Alleyne</persName> flushed to the hue of a
<lb n="09176"/> wild rose and his mouth twitched with a dwarf's passion. He
<lb n="09177"/> shook his fist in the man's face till it seemed to vibrate like the
<lb n="09178"/> knob of some electric machine:
<lb n="09179"/> <said who="Mr Alleyne">―You impertinent ruffian! You impertinent ruffian! I'll make
<lb n="09180"/> short work of you! Wait till you see! You'll apologise to me for
<lb n="09181"/> your impertinence or you'll quit the office instanter! You'll quit
<lb n="09182"/> this, I'm telling you, or you'll apologise to me!</said></p>
<lb /> *  *  *
<lb n="09183"/> <p>He stood in a doorway opposite the offices watching to see
<lb n="09184"/> if the cashier would come out alone. All the clerks passed and
<lb n="09185"/> finally the cashier came out with the chief clerk. It was no use
<lb n="09186"/> trying to say a word to him when he was with the chief clerk.
<lb n="09187"/> The man felt that his position was bad enough. He had been
  <lb n="09188"/> obliged to offer an abject apology to <persName xml:id="ma">Mr Alleyne</persName> for his
<lb n="09189"/> impertinence but he knew what a hornet's nest the office would
<lb n="09190"/> be for him. He could remember the way in which <persName xml:id="ma">Mr Alleyne</persName>
  <lb n="09191"/> had hounded little <persName xml:id="pe">Peake</persName> out of the office in order to make
<lb n="09192"/> room for his own nephew. He felt savage and thirsty and
<lb n="09193"/> revengeful, annoyed with himself and with everyone else. <persName xml:id="ma">Mr
  <lb n="09194"/> Alleyne</persName> would never give him an hour's rest: his life would be a
<lb n="09195"/> hell to him. He had made a proper fool of himself this time.
<lb n="09196"/> Could he not keep his tongue in his cheek? But they had never
  <lb n="09197"/> pulled together from the first, he and <persName xml:id="ma">Mr Alleyne</persName>, ever since the
  <lb n="09198"/> day <persName xml:id="ma">Mr Alleyne</persName> had overheard him mimicking his north of
<lb n="09199"/> Ireland accent to amuse Higgins and Miss Parker: that had
<lb n="09200"/> been the beginning of it. He might have tried Higgins for the
  <lb n="09201"/> money but sure <persName xml:id="hs">Higgins</persName> never had anything for himself. A man
<lb n="09202"/> with two establishments to keep up, of course he couldn't.</p>
<lb n="09203"/> <p>He felt his great body again aching for the comfort of the
<lb n="09204"/> publichouse. The fog had begun to chill him and he wondered
  <lb n="09205"/> could he touch <persName xml:id="pt">Pat</persName> in O'Neill's. He could not touch him for
<lb n="09206"/> more than a bob - and a bob was no use. Yet he must get
<lb n="09207"/> money somewhere or other: he had spent his last penny for the
<lb n="09208"/> g.p. and soon it would be too late for getting money anywhere.
<lb n="09209"/> Suddenly, as he was fingering his watchchain, he thought of
  <lb n="09210"/> <persName xml:id="tk">Terry Kelly</persName>'s pawnoffice in Fleet Street. That was the dart!
<lb n="09211"/> Why didn't he think of it sooner?</p>
<lb n="09212"/> <p>He went through the narrow alley of Temple Bar quickly,
<lb n="09213"/> muttering to himself that they could all go to hell because he
<lb n="09214"/> was going to have a good night of it. The clerk in <persName xml:id="tk">Terry Kelly</persName>'s
<lb n="09215"/> said <emph>A crown!</emph> but the consignor held out for six shillings and in
<lb n="09216"/> the end the six shillings was allowed him literally. He came out
<lb n="09217"/> of the pawnoffice joyfully, making a little cylinder of the coins
<lb n="09218"/> between his thumb and fingers. In Westmoreland Street the
<lb n="09219"/> footpaths were crowded with young men and women returning
<lb n="09220"/> from business and ragged urchins ran here and there yelling out
<lb n="09221"/> the names of the evening editions. The man passed through the
<lb n="09222"/> crowd, looking on the spectacle generally with proud satisfac=
<lb n="09223"/> tion and staring masterfully at the office girls. His head was full
<lb n="09224"/> of the noises of tram gongs and swishing trolleys and his nose
<lb n="09225"/> already sniffed the curling fumes of punch. As he walked on he
<lb n="09226"/> preconsidered the terms in which he would narrate the incident
<lb n="09227"/> to the boys:
<lb n="09228"/> <said who="Farrington">―So, I just looked at him - coolly, you know - and looked at
<lb n="09229"/> her. Then I looked back at him again - taking my time, you
<lb n="09230"/> know. <emph>I don't think that that's a fair question to put to me</emph>,
<lb n="09231"/> says I.</said></p>
  <lb n="09232"/> <p><persName xml:id="nf">Nosey Flynn</persName> was sitting up in his usual corner of Davy
<lb n="09233"/> Byrne's and when he heard the story he stood <persName xml:id="fn">Farrington</persName> a half
<lb n="09234"/> one, saying it was as smart a thing as ever he heard. <persName xml:id="fn">Farrington</persName>
  <lb n="09235"/> stood a drink in his turn. After a while <persName xml:id="on">O'Halloran</persName> and <persName xml:id="ld">Paddy
  <lb n="09236"/> Leonard</persName> came in and the story was repeated to them. <persName xml:id="on">O'Hal=
  <lb n="09237"/> loran</persName> stood tailors of malt, hot, all round and told the story of
<lb n="09238"/> the retort he had made to the chief clerk when he was in
<lb n="09239"/> Callan's of Fownes's Street; but, as the retort was after the
<lb n="09240"/> manner of the liberal shepherds in the eclogues, he had to
  <lb n="09241"/> admit that it was not so clever as <persName xml:id="fn">Farrington</persName>'s retort. At this
  <lb n="09242"/> <persName xml:id="fn">Farrington</persName> told the boys to polish off that and have another.</p>
<lb n="09243"/> <p>Just as they were naming their poisons who should come in
  <lb n="09244"/> but <persName xml:id="hs">Higgins</persName>! Of course he had to join in with the others. The
<lb n="09245"/> men asked him to give his version of it and he did so with great
<lb n="09246"/> vivacity for the sight of five small hot whiskies was very
<lb n="09247"/> exhilarating. Everyone roared laughing when he showed the
  <lb n="09248"/> way in which <persName xml:id="ma">Mr Alleyne</persName> shook his fist in <persName xml:id="fn">Farrington</persName>'s face.
  <lb n="09249"/> Then he imitated <persName xml:id="fn">Farrington</persName>, saying <emph>And here was my nabs, as
  <lb n="09250"/> cool as you please</emph>, while <persName xml:id="fn">Farrington</persName> looked at the company
<lb n="09251"/> out of his heavy dirty eyes, smiling and at times drawing forth
<lb n="09252"/> stray drops of liquor from his moustache with the aid of his
<lb n="09253"/> lower lip.</p>
<lb n="09254"/> <p>When that round was over there was a pause. <persName xml:id="on">O'Halloran</persName>
<lb n="09255"/> had money but neither of the other two seemed to have any so
<lb n="09256"/> the whole party left the shop somewhat regretfully. At the
  <lb n="09257"/> corner of Duke Street <persName xml:id="hs">Higgins</persName> and <persName xml:id="nf">Nosey Flynn</persName> bevelled off to
<lb n="09258"/> the left while the other three turned back towards the city. Rain
<lb n="09259"/> was drizzling down on the cold streets and when they reached
<lb n="09260"/> the Ballast Office <persName xml:id="fn">Farrington</persName> suggested the Scotch House. The
<lb n="09261"/> bar was full of men and loud with the noise of tongues and
<lb n="09262"/> glasses. The three men pushed past the whining matchsellers at
<lb n="09263"/> the door and formed a little party at the corner of the counter.
  <lb n="09264"/> They began to exchange stories. <persName xml:id="ld">Leonard</persName> introduced them to a
  <lb n="09265"/> young fellow named <persName xml:id="we">Weathers</persName> who was performing at the
<lb n="09266"/> Tivoli as an acrobat and knockabout <emph>artiste.</emph> <persName xml:id="fn">Farrington</persName> stood
  <lb n="09267"/> a drink all round. <persName xml:id="we">Weathers</persName> said <said who="Weathers" direct="false">he would take a small Irish
  <lb n="09268"/> and Apollinaris.</said> <persName xml:id="fn">Farrington</persName>, who had definite notions of what
<lb n="09269"/> was what, asked the boys would they have an Apollinaris too:
  <lb n="09270"/> but the boys told <persName xml:id="tm">Tim</persName> to make theirs hot. The talk became
  <lb n="09271"/> theatrical. <persName xml:id="on">O'Halloran</persName> stood a round and then <persName xml:id="fn">Farrington</persName>
  <lb n="09272"/> stood another round, <persName xml:id="we">Weathers</persName> protesting that the hospitality
<lb n="09273"/> was too Irish. He promised to get them in behind the scenes
  <lb n="09274"/> and introduce them to some nice girls. <persName xml:id="on">O'Halloran</persName> said that <said who="O'Halloran" direct="false">he
  <lb n="09275"/> and <persName xml:id="ld">Leonard</persName> would go but that <persName xml:id="fn">Farrington</persName> wouldn't go be=
  <lb n="09276"/> cause he was a married man</said> and <persName xml:id="fn">Farrington</persName>'s heavy dirty eyes
<lb n="09277"/> leered at the company in token that he understood when he
  <lb n="09278"/> was being chaffed. <persName xml:id="we">Weathers</persName> made them all have just one little
<lb n="09279"/> tincture at his expense and promised to meet them later on at
<lb n="09280"/> Mulligan's in Poolbeg Street.</p>
<lb n="09281"/> <p>When the Scotch House closed they went round to Mulli=
<lb n="09282"/> gan's. They went into the parlour at the back and <persName xml:id="on">O'Halloran</persName>
<lb n="09283"/> ordered small hot specials all round. They were all beginning to
  <lb n="09284"/> feel mellow. <persName xml:id="fn">Farrington</persName> was just standing another round when
  <lb n="09285"/> <persName xml:id="we">Weathers</persName> came back. Much to <persName xml:id="fn">Farrington</persName>'s relief he drank a
<lb n="09286"/> glass of bitter this time. Funds were running low but they had
<lb n="09287"/> enough to keep them going. Presently two young women with
<lb n="09288"/> big hats and a young man in a check suit came in and sat at a
  <lb n="09289"/> table close by. <persName xml:id="we">Weathers</persName> saluted them and told the company
  <lb n="09290"/> that they were out of the Tivoli. <persName xml:id="fn">Farrington</persName>'s eyes wandered at
<lb n="09291"/> every moment in the direction of one of the young women.
<lb n="09292"/> There was something striking in her appearance. An immense
<lb n="09293"/> scarf of peacockblue muslin was wound round her hat and
<lb n="09294"/> knotted in a great bow under her chin; and she wore bright
  <lb n="09295"/> yellow gloves reaching to the elbow. <persName xml:id="fn">Farrington</persName> gazed admir=
<lb n="09296"/> ingly at the plump arm which she moved very often and with
<lb n="09297"/> much grace; and, when after a little time she answered his gaze,
<lb n="09298"/> he admired still more her large dark brown eyes. The oblique
<lb n="09299"/> staring expression in them fascinated him. She glanced at him
<lb n="09300"/> once or twice and, when the party was leaving the room, she
<lb n="09301"/> brushed against his chair and said <emph>O, pardon!</emph> in a London
<lb n="09302"/> accent. He watched her leave the room in the hope that she
<lb n="09303"/> would look back at him but he was disappointed. He cursed his
<lb n="09304"/> want of money and cursed all the rounds he had stood,
<lb n="09305"/> particularly all the whiskies and Apollinaris which he had
  <lb n="09306"/> stood to <persName xml:id="we">Weathers</persName>. If there was one thing that he hated it was a
<lb n="09307"/> sponge. He was so angry that he lost count of the conversation
<lb n="09308"/> of his friends.</p>
  <lb n="09309"/> <p>When <persName xml:id="ld">Paddy Leonard</persName> called him he found that they were
  <lb n="09310"/> talking about feats of strength. <persName xml:id="we">Weathers</persName> was showing his
<lb n="09311"/> biceps muscle to the company and boasting so much that the
  <lb n="09312"/> other two had called on <persName xml:id="fn">Farrington</persName> to uphold the national hon=
  <lb n="09313"/> our. <persName xml:id="fn">Farrington</persName> pulled up his sleeve accordingly and showed his
<lb n="09314"/> biceps muscle to the company. The two arms were examined
<lb n="09315"/> and compared and finally it was agreed to have a trial of
<lb n="09316"/> strength. The table was cleared and the two men rested their
  <lb n="09317"/> elbows on it, clasping hands. When <persName xml:id="ld">Paddy Leonard</persName> said <emph>Go!</emph>
<lb n="09318"/> each was to try to bring down the other's hand on to the table.
  <lb n="09319"/> <persName xml:id="fn">Farrington</persName> looked very serious and determined.</p>
<lb n="09320"/> <p>The trial began. After about thirty seconds <persName xml:id="we">Weathers</persName>
<lb n="09321"/> brought his opponent's hand slowly down on to the table. <persName xml:id="fn">Far=
  <lb n="09322"/> rington</persName>'s dark winecoloured face flushed darker still with anger
<lb n="09323"/> and humiliation at having been defeated by such a stripling.
<lb n="09324"/> <said who="Farrington">―You're not to put the weight of your body behind it. Play
  <lb n="09325"/> fair, </said>he said.
  <lb n="09326"/> <said who="Weathers">―Who's not playing fair? </said>said the other.
<lb n="09327"/> <said who="Farrington">―Come on again. The two best out of three.</said></p>
<lb n="09328"/> <p>The trial began again. The veins stood out on <persName xml:id="fn">Farrington</persName>'s
  <lb n="09329"/> forehead and the pallor of <persName xml:id="we">Weathers'</persName> complexion changed to
<lb n="09330"/> peony. Their hands and arms trembled under the stress. After a
  <lb n="09331"/> long struggle <persName xml:id="we">Weathers</persName> again brought his opponent's hand
<lb n="09332"/> slowly on to the table. There was a murmur of applause from
<lb n="09333"/> the spectators. The curate, who was standing beside the table,
<lb n="09334"/> nodded his red head towards the victor and said with loutish
<lb n="09335"/> familiarity:
<lb n="09336"/> <said who="curate">―Ah! that's the knack!</said>
  <lb n="09337"/> <said who="Farrington">―What the hell do you know about it? </said>said <persName xml:id="fn">Farrington</persName>
<lb n="09338"/> fiercely, turning on the man. <said who="Farrington">What do you put in your gab for?</said>
  <lb n="09339"/> <said who="O'Halloran">―'Sh,'sh! </said>said <persName xml:id="on">O'Halloran</persName>, observing the violent expression of
  <lb n="09340"/> <persName xml:id="fn">Farrington</persName>'s face. <said who="O'Halloran">Pony up, boys. We'll have just one little
<lb n="09341"/> smahan more and then we'll be off!</said></p>
<lb n="09342"/> <p>A very sullenfaced man stood at the corner of O'Connell
<lb n="09343"/> Bridge waiting for the little Sandymount tram to take him
<lb n="09344"/> home. He was full of smouldering anger and revengefulness.
<lb n="09345"/> He felt humiliated and discontented: he did not even feel drunk
<lb n="09346"/> and he had only twopence in his pocket. He cursed everything.
<lb n="09347"/> He had done for himself in the office, pawned his watch, spent
<lb n="09348"/> all his money; and he had not even got drunk. He began to feel
<lb n="09349"/> thirsty again and he longed to be back again in the hot reeking
<lb n="09350"/> publichouse. He had lost his reputation as a strong man,
<lb n="09351"/> having been defeated twice by a mere boy. His heart swelled
<lb n="09352"/> with fury and when he thought of the woman in the big hat
<lb n="09353"/> who had brushed against him and said <emph>Pardon!</emph> his fury nearly
<lb n="09354"/> choked him.</p>
<lb n="09355"/> <p>His tram let him down at Shelbourne Road and he steered
<lb n="09356"/> his great body along in the shadow of the wall of the barracks.
<lb n="09357"/> He loathed returning to his home. When he went in by the
<lb n="09358"/> sidedoor he found the kitchen empty and the kitchen fire nearly
<lb n="09359"/> out. He bawled upstairs:
  <lb n="09360"/> <said who="Farrington">―<persName xml:id="ad">Ada</persName>! <persName xml:id="ad">Ada</persName>!</said></p>
<lb n="09361"/> <p>His wife was a little sharpfaced woman who bullied her
<lb n="09362"/> husband when he was sober and was bullied by him when he
<lb n="09363"/> was drunk. They had five children. A little boy came running
<lb n="09364"/> down the stairs.
  <lb n="09365"/> <said who="Farrington">―Who is that? </said>said the man peering through the darkness.
<lb n="09366"/> <said who="Tom">―Me, pa.</said>
  <lb n="09367"/> <said who="Farrington">―Who are you? <persName xml:id="ch">Charlie</persName></said>?
  <lb n="09368"/> <said who="Tom">―No, pa. <persName xml:id="tom">Tom</persName>.</said>
<lb n="09369"/> <said who="Farrington">―Where's your mother?</said>
<lb n="09370"/> <said who="Tom">―She's out at the chapel.</said>
<lb n="09371"/> <said who="Farrington">―That's right .... Did she think of leaving any dinner for me?</said>
<lb n="09372"/> <said who="Tom">―Yes, pa. I ...</said>
<lb n="09373"/> <said who="Farrington">―Light the lamp. What do you mean by having the place in
<lb n="09374"/> darkness? Are the other children in bed?</said></p>
<lb n="09375"/> <p>The man sat down heavily on one of the chairs while the
<lb n="09376"/> little boy lit the lamp. He began to mimick his son's flat accent,
<lb n="09377"/> saying half to himself: <emph>At the chapel. At the chapel, if you
<lb n="09378"/> please!</emph> When the lamp was lit he banged his fist on the table
<lb n="09379"/> and shouted:
<lb n="09380"/> <said who="Farrington">―What's for my dinner?</said>
  <lb n="09381"/> <said who="Tom">―I'm ... going to cook it, pa, </said>said the little boy.</p>
<lb n="09382"/> <p>The man jumped up furiously and pointed to the fire:
<lb n="09383"/> <said who="Farrington">―On that fire! You let the fire out! By God, I'll teach you to do
<lb n="09384"/> that again!</said></p>
<lb n="09385"/> <p>He took a step to the door and seized the walking stick
<lb n="09386"/> which was standing behind it:
  <lb n="09387"/> <said who="Farrington">―I'll teach you to let the fire out! </said>he said, rolling up his sleeve
<lb n="09388"/> in order to give his arm free play.</p>
<lb n="09389"/> <p>The little boy cried <emph>O, pa!</emph> and ran whimpering round the
<lb n="09390"/> table but the man followed him and caught him by the coat.
<lb n="09391"/> The little boy looked about him wildly but, seeing no way of
<lb n="09392"/> escape, fell upon his knees.
  <lb n="09393"/> <said who="Farrington">―Now, you'll let the fire out the next time! </said>said the man,
<lb n="09394"/> striking at him viciously with the stick. <said who="Farrington">Take that, you little
<lb n="09395"/> whelp!</said></p>
<lb n="09396"/> <p>The boy uttered a squeal of pain as the stick cut his thigh.
<lb n="09397"/> He clasped his hands together in the air and his voice shook
<lb n="09398"/> with fright.
  <lb n="09399"/> <said who="Tom">―O, pa! </said>he cried. <said who="Tom">Don't beat me, pa! And I'll ... I'll say a <emph>Hail
<lb n="09400"/> Mary</emph> for you. ... I'll say a <emph>Hail Mary</emph> for you, pa, if you don't
<lb n="09401"/> beat me. ... I'll say a <emph>Hail Mary.</emph> ...</said></p>
