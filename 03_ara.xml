<lb n="04001"/> <p>North Richmond Street, being blind, was a quiet street ex=
<lb n="04002"/> cept at the hour when the Christian Brothers' School set the
<lb n="04003"/> boys free. An uninhabited house of two storeys stood at the
<lb n="04004"/> blind end, detached from its neighbours in a square ground.
<lb n="04005"/> The other houses of the street, conscious of decent lives within
<lb n="04006"/> them, gazed at one another with brown imperturbable faces.</p>
<lb n="04007"/> <p>The former tenant of our house, a priest, had died in the
<lb n="04008"/> back drawingroom. Air, musty from having been long en=
<lb n="04009"/> closed, hung in all the rooms and the waste room behind the
<lb n="04010"/> kitchen was littered with old useless papers. Among these I
<lb n="04011"/> found a few papercovered books, the pages of which were
<lb n="04012"/> curled and damp: <emph>The Abbot</emph> by <persName xml:id="ws">Walter Scott</persName>, <emph>The Devout
<lb n="04013"/> Communicant</emph> and <emph>The Memoirs of Vidocq.</emph> I liked the last best
<lb n="04014"/> because its leaves were yellow. The wild garden behind the
<lb n="04015"/> house contained a central apple tree and a few straggling
<lb n="04016"/> bushes under one of which I found the late tenant's rusty
<lb n="04017"/> bicycle pump. He had been a very charitable priest; in his will
<lb n="04018"/> he had left all his money to institutions and the furniture of his
<lb n="04019"/> house to his sister.</p>
<lb n="04020"/> <p>When the short days of winter came dusk fell before we had
<lb n="04021"/> well eaten our dinners. When we met in the street the houses
<lb n="04022"/> had grown sombre. The space of sky above us was the colour
<lb n="04023"/> of everchanging violet and towards it the lamps of the street
<lb n="04024"/> lifted their feeble lanterns. The cold air stung us and we played
<lb n="04025"/> till our bodies glowed. Our shouts echoed in the silent street.
<lb n="04026"/> The career of our play brought us through the dark muddy
<lb n="04027"/> lanes behind the houses where we ran the gantlet of the rough
<lb n="04028"/> tribes from the cottages, to the back doors of the dark dripping
<lb n="04029"/> gardens where odours arose from the ashpits, to the dark
<lb n="04030"/> odorous stables where a coachman smoothed and combed the
<lb n="04031"/> horse or shook music from the buckled harness. When we re=
<lb n="04032"/> turned to the street light from the kitchen windows had filled
<lb n="04033"/> the areas. If my uncle was seen turning the corner we hid in the
<lb n="04034"/> shadow until we had seen him safely housed. Or if <persName xml:id="mg">Mangan</persName>'s
<lb n="04035"/> sister came out on the doorstep to call her brother in to his tea
<lb n="04036"/> we watched her from our shadow peer up and down the street.
<lb n="04037"/> We waited to see whether she would remain or go in and if she
  <lb n="04038"/> remained we left our shadow and walked up to <persName xml:id="mg">Mangan</persName>'s steps
<lb n="04039"/> resignedly. She was waiting for us, her figure defined by the
<lb n="04040"/> light from the half-opened door. Her brother always teased her
<lb n="04041"/> before he obeyed and I stood by the railings looking at her. Her
<lb n="04042"/> dress swung as she moved her body and the soft rope of her
<lb n="04043"/> hair tossed from side to side.</p>
<lb n="04044"/> <p>Every morning I lay on the floor in the front parlour
<lb n="04045"/> watching her door. The blind was pulled down to within an
<lb n="04046"/> inch of the sash so that I could not be seen. When she came out
<lb n="04047"/> on the doorstep my heart leaped. I ran to the hall, seized my
<lb n="04048"/> books and followed her. I kept her brown figure always in my
<lb n="04049"/> eye and when we came near the point at which our ways
<lb n="04050"/> diverged I quickened my pace and passed her. This happened
<lb n="04051"/> morning after morning. I had never spoken to her except for a
<lb n="04052"/> few casual words and yet her name was like a summons to all
<lb n="04053"/> my foolish blood.</p>
<lb n="04054"/> <p>Her image accompanied me even in places the most hostile
<lb n="04055"/> to romance. On Saturday evenings when my aunt went market=
<lb n="04056"/> ing I had to go to carry some of the parcels. We walked through
<lb n="04057"/> the flaring streets, jostled by drunken men and bargaining
<lb n="04058"/> women, amid the curses of labourers, the shrill litanies of shop
<lb n="04059"/> boys who stood on guard by the barrels of pigs' cheeks, the
<lb n="04060"/> nasal chanting of street singers who sang a <emph>come-all-you</emph> about
<lb n="04061"/> O'Donovan Rossa or a ballad about the troubles in our native
<lb n="04062"/> land. These noises converged in a single sensation of life for
<lb n="04063"/> me: I imagined that I bore my chalice safely through a throng
<lb n="04064"/> of foes. Her name sprang to my lips at moments in strange
<lb n="04065"/> prayers and praises which I myself did not understand. My eyes
<lb n="04066"/> were often full of tears (I could not tell why) and at times a
<lb n="04067"/> flood from my heart seemed to pour itself out into my bosom. I
<lb n="04068"/> thought little of the future. I did not know whether I would
<lb n="04069"/> ever speak to her or not or, if I spoke to her, how I could tell
<lb n="04070"/> her of my confused adoration. But my body was like a harp
<lb n="04071"/> and her words and gestures were like fingers running upon the
<lb n="04072"/> wires.</p>
<lb n="04073"/> <p>One evening I went into the back drawingroom in which the
<lb n="04074"/> priest had died. It was a dark rainy evening and there was no
<lb n="04075"/> sound in the house. Through one of the broken panes I heard
<lb n="04076"/> the rain impinge upon the earth, the fine incessant needles of
<lb n="04077"/> water playing in the sodden beds. Some distant lamp or lighted
<lb n="04078"/> window gleamed below me. I was thankful that I could see so
<lb n="04079"/> little. All my senses seemed to desire to veil themselves and,
<lb n="04080"/> feeling that I was about to slip from them, I pressed the palms
<lb n="04081"/> of my hands together until they trembled, murmuring: <emph>O love!
<lb n="04082"/> O love!</emph> many times.</p>
<lb n="04083"/> <p>At last she spoke to me. When she addressed the first words
<lb n="04084"/> to me I was so confused that I did not know what to answer.
<lb n="04085"/> She asked me was I going to <emph>Araby.</emph> I forget whether I answered
<lb n="04086"/> yes or no. <said who="Mangan's sister">It would be a splendid bazaar, she said; she would
  <lb n="04087"/> love to go.</said>
<lb n="04088"/> <said who="narrator">―And why can't you? I asked.</said></p>
<lb n="04089"/> <p>While she spoke she turned a silver bracelet round and
<lb n="04090"/> round her wrist. She could not go, she said, because there
<lb n="04091"/> would be a retreat that week in her convent. Her brother and
<lb n="04092"/> two other boys were fighting for their caps and I was alone at
<lb n="04093"/> the railings. She held one of the spikes, bowing her head to=
<lb n="04094"/> wards me. The light from the lamp opposite our door caught
<lb n="04095"/> the white curve of her neck, lit up the hair that rested there
<lb n="04096"/> and, falling, lit up the hand upon the railing. It fell over one
<lb n="04097"/> side of her dress and caught the white border of a petticoat, just
<lb n="04098"/> visible as she stood at ease.
<lb n="04099"/> <said who="Mangan's sister">―It's well for you, she said.</said>
<lb n="04100"/> <said who="narrator">―If I go, I said, I will bring you something.</said></p>
<lb n="04101"/> <p>What innumerable follies laid waste my waking and sleeping
<lb n="04102"/> thoughts after that evening! I wished to annihilate the tedious
<lb n="04103"/> intervening days. I chafed against the work of school. At night
<lb n="04104"/> in my bedroom and by day in the classroom her image came
<lb n="04105"/> between me and the page I strove to read. The syllables of the
<lb n="04106"/> word <emph>Araby</emph> were called to me through the silence in which my
<lb n="04107"/> soul luxuriated and cast an eastern enchantment over me. I
<lb n="04108"/> asked for leave to go to the bazaar on Saturday night. My aunt
<lb n="04109"/> was surprised and hoped it was not some freemason affair. I
<lb n="04110"/> answered few questions in class. I watched my master's face
<lb n="04111"/> pass from amiability to sternness; he hoped I was not beginning
<lb n="04112"/> to idle. I could not call my wandering thoughts together. I had
<lb n="04113"/> hardly any patience with the serious work of life which, now
<lb n="04114"/> that it stood between me and my desire, seemed to me child's
<lb n="04115"/> play, ugly monotonous child's play.</p>
<lb n="04116"/> <p>On Saturday morning I reminded my uncle that I wished to
<lb n="04117"/> go to the bazaar in the evening. He was fussing at the hallstand,
<lb n="04118"/> looking for the hatbrush, and answered me curtly:
<lb n="04119"/> <said who="narrator's uncle">―Yes, boy, I know.</said></p>
<lb n="04120"/> <p>As he was in the hall I could not go into the front parlour
<lb n="04121"/> and lie at the window. I left the house in bad humour and
<lb n="04122"/> walked slowly towards the school. The air was pitilessly raw
<lb n="04123"/> and already my heart misgave me.</p>
<lb n="04124"/> <p>When I came home to dinner my uncle had not yet been
<lb n="04125"/> home. Still it was early. I sat staring at the clock for some time
<lb n="04126"/> and when its ticking began to irritate me I left the room. I
<lb n="04127"/> mounted the staircase and gained the upper part of the house.
<lb n="04128"/> The high cold empty gloomy rooms liberated me and I went
<lb n="04129"/> from room to room singing. From the front window I saw my
<lb n="04130"/> companions playing below in the street. Their cries reached me
<lb n="04131"/> weakened and indistinct and, leaning my forehead against the
<lb n="04132"/> cool glass, I looked over at the dark house where she lived. I
<lb n="04133"/> may have stood there for an hour seeing nothing but the
<lb n="04134"/> brownclad figure cast by my imagination, touched discreetly by
<lb n="04135"/> the lamplight at the curved neck, at the hand upon the railings
<lb n="04136"/> and at the border below the dress.</p>
  <lb n="04137"/> <p>When I came downstairs again I found <persName xml:id="mc">Mrs Mercer</persName> sitting at
<lb n="04138"/> the fire. She was an old garrulous woman, a pawnbroker's
<lb n="04139"/> widow who collected used stamps for some pious purpose. I
<lb n="04140"/> had to endure the gossip of the teatable. The meal was
<lb n="04141"/> prolonged beyond an hour and still my uncle did not come.
  <lb n="04142"/> <persName xml:id="mc">Mrs Mercer</persName> stood up to go: she was sorry she couldn't wait
<lb n="04143"/> any longer but it was after eight o'clock and she did not like to
<lb n="04144"/> be out late as the night air was bad for her. When she had gone
<lb n="04145"/> I began to walk up and down the room, clenching my fists. My
<lb n="04146"/> aunt said:
<lb n="04147"/> <said who="narrator's aunt">―I'm afraid you may put off your bazaar for this night of Our
<lb n="04148"/> Lord.</said></p>
<lb n="04149"/> <p>At nine o'clock I heard my uncle's latchkey in the halldoor. I
<lb n="04150"/> heard him talking to himself and heard the hallstand rocking
<lb n="04151"/> when it had received the weight of his overcoat. I could
<lb n="04152"/> interpret these signs. When he was midway through his dinner I
<lb n="04153"/> asked him to give me the money to go to the bazaar. He had
<lb n="04154"/> forgotten.
<lb n="04155"/> <said who="narrator's uncle">―The people are in bed and after their first sleep now, he said.</said></p>
<lb n="04156"/> <p>I did not smile. My aunt said to him energetically:
<lb n="04157"/> <said who="narrator's aunt">―Can't you give him the money and let him go? You've kept
<lb n="04158"/> him late enough as it is.</said></p>
<lb n="04159"/> <p>My uncle said he was very sorry he had forgotten. He said
<lb n="04160"/> he believed in the old saying: <emph>All work and no play makes Jack
<lb n="04161"/> a dull boy.</emph> He asked me where I was going and when I had told
<lb n="04162"/> him a second time he asked me did I know <emph>The Arab's Farewell
<lb n="04163"/> to his Steed.</emph> When I left the kitchen he was about to recite the
<lb n="04164"/> opening lines of the piece to my aunt.</p>
<lb n="04165"/> <p>I held a florin tightly in my hand as I strode down Bucking=
<lb n="04166"/> ham Street towards the station. The sight of the streets
<lb n="04167"/> thronged with buyers and glaring with gas recalled to me the
<lb n="04168"/> purpose of my journey. I took my seat in a third class carriage
<lb n="04169"/> of a deserted train. After an intolerable delay the train moved
<lb n="04170"/> out of the station slowly. It crept onward among ruinous
<lb n="04171"/> houses and over the twinkling river. At Westland Row Station a
<lb n="04172"/> crowd of people pressed at the carriage doors; but the porters
<lb n="04173"/> moved them back, saying that it was a special train for the
<lb n="04174"/> bazaar. I remained alone in the bare carriage. In a few minutes
<lb n="04175"/> the train drew up beside an improvised wooden platform. I
<lb n="04176"/> passed out on to the road and saw by the lighted dial of a clock
<lb n="04177"/> that it was ten minutes to ten. In front of me was a large
<lb n="04178"/> building which displayed the magical name.</p>
<lb n="04179"/> <p>I could not find any sixpenny entrance and, fearing that the
<lb n="04180"/> bazaar would be closed, I passed in quickly through a turnstile,
<lb n="04181"/> handing a shilling to a wearylooking man. I found myself in a
<lb n="04182"/> big hall girdled at half its height by a gallery. Nearly all the
<lb n="04183"/> stalls were closed and the greater part of the hall was in
<lb n="04184"/> darkness. I recognised a silence like that which pervades a
<lb n="04185"/> church after a service. I walked into the centre of the bazaar
<lb n="04186"/> timidly. A few people were gathered about the stalls which
<lb n="04187"/> were still open. Before a curtain over which the words <emph>Café
<lb n="04188"/> Chantant</emph> were written in coloured lamps two men were count=
<lb n="04189"/> ing money on a salver. I listened to the fall of the coins.</p>
<lb n="04190"/> <p>Remembering with difficulty why I had come I went over to
<lb n="04191"/> one of the stalls and examined porcelain vases and flowered
<lb n="04192"/> teasets. At the door of the stall a young lady was talking and
<lb n="04193"/> laughing with two young gentlemen. I remarked their English
<lb n="04194"/> accents and listened vaguely to their conversation.
<lb n="04195"/> <said who="young lady">―O, I never said such a thing!</said>
<lb n="04196"/> <said who="young gentleman one">―O, but you did!</said>
<lb n="04197"/> <said who="young lady">―O, but I didn't!</said>
<lb n="04198"/> <said who="young gentleman one">―Didn't she say that?</said>
<lb n="04199"/> <said who="young gentleman two">―She did. I heard her.</said>
<lb n="04200"/> <said who="young lady">―O, there's a ... fib!</said></p>
<lb n="04201"/> <p>Observing me the young lady came over and asked me did I
<lb n="04202"/> wish to buy anything. The tone of her voice was not encour=
<lb n="04203"/> aging: she seemed to have spoken to me out of a sense of duty. I
<lb n="04204"/> looked humbly at the great jars that stood like eastern guards
<lb n="04205"/> at either side of the dark entrance to her stall and murmured:
<lb n="04206"/> <said who="I">―No, thank you.</said></p>
<lb n="04207"/> <p>The young lady changed the position of one of the vases and
<lb n="04208"/> went back to the two young men. They began to talk of the
<lb n="04209"/> same subject. Once or twice the young lady glanced at me over
<lb n="04210"/> her shoulder.</p>
<lb n="04211"/> <p>I lingered before her stall, though I knew my stay was
<lb n="04212"/> useless, to make my interest in her wares seem the more real.
<lb n="04213"/> Then I turned away slowly and walked down the middle of the
<lb n="04214"/> bazaar. I allowed the two pennies to fall against the sixpence in
<lb n="04215"/> my pocket. I heard a voice call from one end of the gallery that
<lb n="04216"/> the light was out. The upper part of the hall was now com=
<lb n="04217"/> pletely dark.</p>
<lb n="04218"/> <p>Gazing up into the darkness I saw myself as a creature
<lb n="04219"/> driven and derided by vanity: and my eyes burned with anguish
<lb n="04220"/> and anger.</p>
